    question: 'What is Push?',
    renderAnswer: () => (
      <Answer>
        <Span>Push (previously EPNS) is a decentralized and blockchain-agnostic communication protocol for the entire web3 world that aims to provide the users to receive notifications for on-chain or off-chain activity.</Span>
        <Span>Push allows Web3 actors (users, dapps, service providers) to create notifications that are can be based on any off-chain or on-chain logic that can be triggered via smart contract, backend or dApps. These come from an open communication network (push nodes) and are tied to wallet addresses allowing any crypto wallet, frontend, or infra service to display it to Web3 users.</Span>
      </Answer>
    )
  },
  {
    question: 'Why are push notifications important for Web3?',
    renderAnswer: () => (
      <Answer>
        <Span>Push notifications have transformed the Web2 ecosystem. They have enabled applications to have more direct relationships with users and have yielded fundamental strategies about marketing, product fit, user behavior, and more. The problem with Web2 notifications, however, is that they are entirely created and prescribed by the applications themselves, and are not always net-useful to the end user. Users rarely have a choice about what kinds of notifications they wish to receive, and more often than not, notifications are purely marketing vehicles to drive revenue for the applications.</Span>
        <Span><i>Decentralized</i> notifications, on the other hand, provide the emerging Web3 ecosystem with the benefits of a robust notification ecosystem without the exploitative or centralized drawbacks of Web2 notifications. Applications need ways to communicate with users in more immediate and event-initiated ways than through Twitter, Discord, or email. Users deserve to control what notifications they receive, and should benefit from the open source nature of Web3 by requesting notifications about protocol behavior.</Span>
      </Answer>
    )
  },
  {
    question: 'How can decentralized Push notifications be used?',
    renderAnswer: () => (
      <Answer>
        <Span>We believe almost any application in the Web3 ecosystem can benefit from notifications. Some of the highest-impact immediate opportunities are:</Span>
        <Span><b>DEXes:</b> DEX users can be notified when the price of a token falls or rises a certain percentage. Users can also set up notifications for when their trades are executed and completed, rather than having to check back to see if trades were completed (especially during times of high network traffic). Users can also set up notifications for when gas prices go down or up to help them decide when to trade.</Span>
        <Span><b>DeFi:</b> Lending protocol users can set up notifications to be informed when they are about to be liquidated, rather than needing to check in regularly to ensure. LP providers can also set up notifications about impermanent loss in case they wish to cut their losses short during a volatile market. If DeFi users are interacting with a particularly young or untested protocol, they could set up notifications to inform them if large amounts of funds are being moved around in ways that could signal instability within that dapp.</Span>
        <Span><b>NFTs and Gaming:</b> Trading of NFTs or goods on markets or within games can be connected to Push to inform users 1) when certain goods go on sale or auction; 2) when auctions go live from crypto-artists; 3) when a bid is accepted or topped; 4) when one’s own NFT (or anyone else’s) sells.</Span>
        <Span><b>ENS/Consumer Apps:</b> Apps like the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) can notify users when their subscriptions are about to expire, rather than expecting users to remember or check in regularly to remind themselves of upcoming dates.</Span>
      </Answer>
    )
  },
  {
    question: 'What is Push\'s solution?',
    renderAnswer: () => (
      <Answer>
        <Span>The Push solution is comprised of 4 components: <b>Service</b>, <b>Channel</b>, <b>Subscriber</b>, <b>User</b>.</Span>
        <Span><b>⚬ Service:</b> A service is any user, wallet owner, dapp, or Web3 services that would like to send notifications. Essentially, a service is any addressable user of Push.</Span>
        <Span><b>⚬ Channel:</b> A channel is any service that has activated itself on the Push Protocol and can therefore begin creating notifications.</Span>
        <Span><b>⚬ User:</b> Any participant in Web3 that wishes to receive notifications about a dapp, wallet, or smart contract.</Span>
        <Span><b>⚬ Subscriber:</b> A user that has elected to receive notifications from any particular channel (i.e. someone who Opts-In to a channel that sends out a specific notification).</Span>
