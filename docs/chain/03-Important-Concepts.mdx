# Important Concepts

Before diving into the SDK and how you can integrate Push Chain to build the new wave of consumer-centric applications, letâ€™s review what Push Chain is.

## What is the Transaction Category?

The transaction category in Push Chain refers to the type of operation the transaction represents, such as email, blog, notifications, or other specific use cases. 

It helps identify and organize transactions within the network, allowing precise handling and retrieval tailored to their purpose.

**Note**: Each transaction must have *one* category assigned to it.

## How many recipients can a transaction have?

A transaction can have **at least 1 recipient**, but there is no upper limit to the number of recipients. 

Recipients can be wallets on **multiple chains** and do not need to all be on the same chain. For example, a transaction can include recipients on Ethereum, Solana, or other supported blockchains.

## What can the transaction payload contain?

The transaction payload can be **anything**, as long as it is represented in bytes. 

The data payload can include any information that suits your application's needs, provided it is associated with a valid **transaction category**. For example:  
- An **email** as part of a messaging application.  
- A **social media post**, like a text, image, or video.  
- A **notification** or event trigger for your application.  
- **Game state data** for a gaming app.
