# Wallet Absctraction

This section covers the `connect` function of the Push Wallet SDK and the technical advantages it brings to developers and users.

  <title>{`Push Wallet Connect | Push Chain | Push Documentation`}</title>

## Connect to Push Wallet

The `connect` function allows seamless integration of a user's wallet with your DApp, leveraging decentralized identifiers (DIDs), session keys, and a streamlined user experience.

If it's the first time the user is connecting with the Push Wallet, an interface will show up to allow the user to create an account.

### Key Benefits of Using Push Wallet `connect`

- **Decentralized Identity (DID):**
  - Push Wallet provides each user with a DID, enabling universal identity mapping across multiple blockchains.
  - No need to rely on separate accounts per chain; transactions and actions across wallets are unified under a single identifier.

- **Session Keys for Simplified UX:**
  - Users can authorize a session key that eliminates the need for constant signing of transactions, enhancing usability without compromising security.
  - The session key can be revoked or regenerated at any time, ensuring complete user control over permissions.

- **Whitelist for Secure DApp Connections:**
  - Ensures that only trusted DApps can initiate and maintain connections, verified through user signatures.
  - Reduces the risk of unauthorized or phishing attempts to connect wallets.

- **Interoperability Across Blockchains:**
  - Supports interactions with multiple EVM and non-EVM chains, simplifying wallet management for multi-chain DApps.

## Example: Connecting to Push Wallet

Hereâ€™s an example of how to implement the `connect` function using the Push Wallet SDK:

```typescript
async function pushWalletLoginHandler(): Promise<void> {
  try {
    if (pushNetwork) {
      // Establish wallet connection
      const pushAddress: string = await pushNetwork.wallet.connect();
      
      // Sign a message for whitelisting the DApp connection
      await pushNetwork.wallet.sign(
        toBytes('Accept Connection Request From DApp')
      );
      
      // Store or process the connected account
      setPushAccount(pushAddress);
    }
  } catch (err) {
    alert(`Error connecting to Push Wallet: ${err.message}`);
  }
}
```

## When to Use the `connect` function

The `connect` function is best used when your DApp requires:

- Persistent user sessions without repetitive signature requests.
- Access to user identity across multiple wallets and chains.
- Secure, user-consented interactions with blockchain wallets.

## Return type for `connect` function

| Type     | Remarks          |
| -------- | ---------------- |
| `string` | Push Wallet Address |

## Example of return payload

```
push:devnet:push1aeesnem57jdw838rpxwmxnwcxrvzvyswcydrwy
```

## Flow for Connecting 

If it's the first time the user is connecting, then the user will be prompted to create an account.

![Creating Account](../images/creating-account.png)

The user will have to sign with the preferred wallet, EVM or non-EVM.

![Loading Creation](../images/loading-creation-of-account.png)

After signing the message, then a Push DID will be created to the user and linked to the EVM or non-EVM wallet from the user.
