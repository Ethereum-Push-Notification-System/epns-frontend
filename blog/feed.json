They’ll be capable of handling requests from any chain, which will then be relayed to the Ethereum-based Push core contracts for validations and state changes.</li>\n<li><strong>Upgraded Incentivized Chats:</strong> Users will be able to initiate and receive paid chats from any chain to any chain, as long as both are supported by the framework.</li>\n<li><strong>Cross-Chain Requests (CCR):</strong> This feature allows users to perform actions like creating channels or requests on any blockchain, rather than just on Ethereum. This move is essential for Push to reach a broader audience across different blockchains, including Layer 2 (L2), Layer 3 (L3), and app-specific chains, without increasing friction in the user’s experience with our tech.</li>\n<li>A new hub for builders: All of this will enable a new hub for builders to experiment and widen the boundaries of innovation with web3-based consumer apps.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We then moved on to Wormhole’s views on the significance of the integration of Push’s smart contracts with their tech:</p>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5\" id=\"why-push-x-wormhole\">Why Push x Wormhole?<a href=\"https://push.org/blog/ama-with-wormhole-for-cross-chain-requests-pre-pip#why-push-x-wormhole\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Why Push x Wormhole?\" title=\"Direct link to Why Push x Wormhole?\">​</a></h3>\n<p>The integration centers on making the $PUSH token natively fungible across all of the connected chains that Push wants, while enabling native-messaging of all sorts on all involved. We came up with this new multi-chain framework, the Native Token Transfer framework, to enable seamless token transfers across different chains without the need for liquidity pools or complex bridging mechanisms. We both agree that the industry needs to involve into one that is truly interoperable. This is a major step in that direction.</p>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5\" id=\"why-is-pre-pip-3ccr-important\">Why is Pre-PIP 3/CCR important?<a href=\"https://push.org/blog/ama-with-wormhole-for-cross-chain-requests-pre-pip#why-is-pre-pip-3ccr-important\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Why is Pre-PIP 3/CCR important?\" title=\"Direct link to Why is Pre-PIP 3/CCR important?\">​</a></h3>\n<p>The proposal includes detailed research and considerations, focusing on minimal changes to the existing architecture, a security-first approach, and how the technical aspects of Wormhole will enable CCR.

This is currently a friction point for users who primarily operate on other EVM-compatible chains and even non-EVM users.</p>\n<p>Cross-chain requests will eliminate the need to switch to the Ethereum Network making it possible to create a channel, use Push services, or interact with Push Protocol’s Ethereum smart contract from any blockchain they like, whether it’s another EVM chain or non-EVM chain.</p>\n<p>Additionally, this was not just something that users faced but more for Push Protocol as it limits Push Protocol's ability to tap into other chains and help solve the communication/notification issues of those chains adequately. This constraint hinders the protocol from reaching a broader audience and solving communication issues across diverse blockchain environments.</p>\n<p>Therefore, by enabling the Cross-Chain Request feature, Push Protocol can primarily significantly enhance the UX for average users as well as channel creators/managers from not just Ethereum but multiple other EVM/Non-EVM chains as well. It also allows the protocol to expand its market reach, attract users from different chains, and foster a more interconnected blockchain ecosystem.</p>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5\" id=\"importance-of-ccr-cross-chain-requests\">Importance of CCR (Cross-Chain Requests):<a href=\"https://push.org/blog/cross-chain-requests-pre-pip#importance-of-ccr-cross-chain-requests\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Importance of CCR (Cross-Chain Requests):\" title=\"Direct link to Importance of CCR (Cross-Chain Requests):\">​</a></h3>\n<p>The Cross Chain Requests (CCR) feature is crucial for the future success and growth of the Push Protocol:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Enhanced User Experience:</strong> The CCR feature will significantly enhance user experience by eliminating the need for users to switch networks or manually bridge tokens to interact with the Push Core contract on Ethereum. This streamlined process will allow users to perform key actions like channel creation and incentivize chat requests directly from their preferred blockchain, reducing both complexity and transaction costs. By making these features accessible from various chains, CCR removes barriers for new and existing users, fostering a more inclusive and user-friendly environment.</li>\n<li><strong>Broader Reach:</strong> The CCR feature will expand the reach of Push Protocol across the blockchain ecosystem. By enabling interactions from multiple EVM and non-EVM chains, CCR will not only broaden the protocol's user base but also tap into diverse blockchain communities that might benefit from Push’s communication and notification features. This increased accessibility helps Push Protocol grow its market presence and integrate with a wider range of blockchain projects, ultimately supporting the development of a more interconnected and collaborative blockchain network.</li>\n<li><strong>Revolutionizing Web3 Communications</strong>: CCR future-proofs Push Protocol against the rapid evolution of the blockchain space. As new chains and technologies emerge, CCR’s cross-chain capabilities ensure that Push Protocol remains adaptable and relevant. By leveraging established technologies like Wormhole’s NTT framework and Relayers, CCR positions Push Protocol to embrace future advancements and continue delivering value to its users across an ever-expanding blockchain landscape.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Here’s a simple overview of how CCR works:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Initiate Request</strong>: A user on another blockchain (like Polygon) wants to perform an action, such as creating a new channel for sending notifications.</li>\n<li><strong>Submit Details</strong>: The user uses a special function on the Push Communicator contract on their preferred blockchain to submit the request, providing the necessary details and approving the $PUSH tokens for the action.</li>\n<li><strong>Send Data and Tokens</strong>: The Push Communicator contract validates the input, creates a message payload, and uses Wormhole Relayers to securely send this payload and the $PUSH tokens to the Push Core contract on Ethereum.</li>\n<li><strong>Process Request</strong>: On Ethereum, the Push Core contract receives the message and tokens, decodes the request, validates it, and performs the required action.</li>\n<li><strong>Completion</strong>: The request is completed on Ethereum, and any unused native tokens are refunded to the user on their original blockchain.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Cover Image of Diagram for Cross-Chain Requests\" src=\"https://push.org/assets/images/image1-2f89fa71911892f627b09ac1af285b45.webp\" width=\"1600\" height=\"901\" class=\"img_ev3q\"></p>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5\" id=\"visualizing-channel-creation-with-the-ccr-feature\">Visualizing Channel Creation with the CCR feature<a href=\"https://push.org/blog/cross-chain-requests-pre-pip#visualizing-channel-creation-with-the-ccr-feature\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Visualizing Channel Creation with the CCR feature\" title=\"Direct link to Visualizing Channel Creation with the CCR feature\">​</a></h3>\n<p>Imagine Bob, a Polygon user, wants to create a channel for sending notifications.</p>\n<p>Previously, he'd need to switch to Ethereum, bridge tokens, and change networks. With CCR, Bob simply uses the familiar Push Communicator contract on Polygon.</p>\n<p>The contract acts as a bridge, relaying Bob's request (channel details) and the required PUSH tokens (bridged via Wormhole) to the Push Core contract on Ethereum.</p>\n<p>All behind the scenes, without Bob ever leaving Polygon! This creates a seamless experience for users on any chain, opening Push Protocol to a wider audience.</p>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5\" id=\"why-not-just-deploy-push-core-everywhere\">Why Not Just Deploy Push Core Everywhere?<a href=\"https://push.org/blog/cross-chain-requests-pre-pip#why-not-just-deploy-push-core-everywhere\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Why Not Just Deploy Push Core Everywhere?\" title=\"Direct link to Why Not Just Deploy Push Core Everywhere?\">​</a></h3>\n<p>While putting Push Core on every blockchain might seem easy, it's quite tricky.</p>\n<p>It would be hard to manage separate fees and keep all the information on different chains in sync, which could even be risky.</p>\n<p>That's why we're improving the existing Push Communicator contracts to handle these requests. We'll also use a reliable system called Wormhole to securely send information and tokens between blockchains. This way, everything works smoothly without needing Push Core on every chain.

The common goal of this design shift is to achieve scalability and, as a result, a higher degree of interoperability.</p>\n<p>But as the web3 dev community continues to take bigger strides in achieving transactional interoperability, app-to-user, app-to-app, and user-to-user communication are still at nascent steps.</p>\n<p>Push is working towards diminishing this divide between transactional and communication interoperability by building a robust, secure fabric that weaves multiple chains and services together by forming the <strong>“Universal Layer2 Of Communication”</strong>.</p>\n<h2 class=\"anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5\" id=\"fragmented-ecosystem\">Fragmented Ecosystem<a href=\"https://push.org/blog/interoperable-communications-moving-across-an-open-web-with-push#fragmented-ecosystem\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Fragmented Ecosystem\" title=\"Direct link to Fragmented Ecosystem\">​</a></h2>\n<p>Web3 operates on a multitude of blockchains, each with its own protocols, standards, and its own unique set of rules. This creates independent and isolated silos of information, making it difficult for users, services and applications built on separate chains to interact and communicate with each other unanimously.</p>\n<p>Push continues to form a communication blanket over the fragmented ecosystem and provide its communication services to multiple EVM and non-EVM based chains. At present, Push supports over 7 networks including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ethereum</li>\n<li>Polyogn</li>\n<li>Polygon zkEVM</li>\n<li>Arbitrum</li>\n<li>Binance Smart Chain (BNB)</li>\n<li>Fuse</li>\n<li>Cyber</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>The Communicator contracts (Push Comm V2) serve as a middleware for listening to inbound communications</strong>&nbsp;and events from the Client Application’s smart contract. Thus, shouldering the responsibility of on-chain communication across contracts deployed on multiple chains (EVM and non-EVM).</p>\n<p>Notifications can not always be triggered as a result of an on-chain event. Many notifications, especially the ones that are more inclined towards driving engagement can be considered off-chain. Push ensures that any frontend, service, backend or smart contract can easily send communication payloads across the diverse participants and devices ( App, Wallet, Extension, Frontends and more).</p>\n<h2 class=\"anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5\" id=\"data-availability-no-communication-da-layer\">Data Availability (no communication DA layer)<a href=\"https://push.org/blog/interoperable-communications-moving-across-an-open-web-with-push#data-availability-no-communication-da-layer\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Data Availability (no communication DA layer)\" title=\"Direct link to Data Availability (no communication DA layer)\">​</a></h2>\n<p>Traditionally, Data Availability (DA) ensures that the data needed to validate a block is accessible to the majority of network participants. However, in the context of interoperable communications within Web3, we need a broader concept: “<strong>Communication DA”</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>What's the problem?</strong>\nFrom an end user's perspective, app notifications and other forms of read-write communications (messaging, groupchats, videocalls) should be accessible regardless of the platform, service, hardware and underlying chain they use.  Previously, there was no standardized middleware mechanism to link communication across platforms and chains.</p>\n<p>Push solves this problem. Being an open network, Push enables any frontend, service, or backend to securely tap into the Push network and extract the necessary communication payloads in a platform-agnostic manner.</p>\n<p>Simply put, <strong>your communication travels with your web3 identity: your wallet.</strong></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Push Delivery Nodes\" src=\"https://push.org/assets/images/image1-7aaf4b71343d3f54e055b4a4a9e86577.webp\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1124\" class=\"img_ev3q\"></p>\n<h2 class=\"anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5\" id=\"benefits-to-protocols-and-dapps\">Benefits to Protocols and DApps<a href=\"https://push.org/blog/interoperable-communications-moving-across-an-open-web-with-push#benefits-to-protocols-and-dapps\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Benefits to Protocols and DApps\" title=\"Direct link to Benefits to Protocols and DApps\">​</a></h2>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5\" id=\"1-communications-web-3-wallets\">1.

However, there is no standardized way for these apps to communicate back with users through the same entrance point i.e. your wallet.</p>\n<h2 class=\"anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5\" id=\"solution\">Solution<a href=\"https://push.org/blog/how-wallets-use-push-to-become-a-super-app#solution\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Solution\" title=\"Direct link to Solution\">​</a></h2>\n<p><strong>Push helps us solve these challenges.</strong></p>\n<p>With the help of an open - decentralized and secure network supported across multiple chains, Push facilitates any wallet, DApp, service or smart contract to tap into the network and fetch notifications with ease.</p>\n<p>With the motive of forming a universal communication layer of web3, Push Protocol is expanding its support to multiple chains including <strong>Ethereum, Polygon, BSC, Arbitrum, Polygon zkEVM, Cyber and Fuse</strong>.</p>\n<p>To date, Push has sent over <strong>80 Million Notifications</strong> across <strong>230k+ subscribers</strong>.</p>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5\" id=\"journey-from-wallet-to-a-super-app-wallet-from-our-partners\">Journey from Wallet to a Super App Wallet from our Partners:<a href=\"https://push.org/blog/how-wallets-use-push-to-become-a-super-app#journey-from-wallet-to-a-super-app-wallet-from-our-partners\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Journey from Wallet to a Super App Wallet from our Partners:\" title=\"Direct link to Journey from Wallet to a Super App Wallet from our Partners:\">​</a></h3>\n<p>Lets take a thorough look at how our partner wallets are adopting Push to become a Super App.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Push enables interoperable communications\" src=\"https://push.org/assets/images/image1-773c84f6611fb60de497f032b88e6813.webp\" width=\"2226\" height=\"1248\" class=\"img_ev3q\"></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Unstoppable Lite Wallet</li>\n<li>Push Metamask Snap</li>\n<li>Shapeshift Governance Wallet</li>\n<li>Verso Wallet</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5\" id=\"1unstoppable-domains-lite-wallet\">1.Unstoppable Domains Lite Wallet<a href=\"https://push.org/blog/how-wallets-use-push-to-become-a-super-app#1unstoppable-domains-lite-wallet\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to 1.Unstoppable Domains Lite Wallet\" title=\"Direct link to 1.Unstoppable Domains Lite Wallet\">​</a></h3>\n<p>Unstoppable Domain Wallets are cryptocurrency addresses used to store users’ web3 domains in addition to tokens and digital collectables.\nAn Unstoppable Wallet with a valid domain acts as a web3 social identifier for enabling domain-to-domain in-app messaging!</p>\n<p><strong>Push x UD: Empowering wallet-to-wallet messaging with ease!</strong></p>\n<img src=\"https://push.org/assets/images/image3-d7830c6dc6f987f1db382732689dafa6.webp\" alt=\"Unstoppable Domains Lite Wallet\" width=\"353\" height=\"100%\" class=\"SharedStyling__Image-sc-1enui31-9 efFBTI\">\n<p>Push is proud to enable the next frontier of inter-domain communication by powering notifications and messaging support for over <strong>3.58 million</strong> UD users across more than <strong>300 group chats</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>What type of users primarily use Unstoppable Lite Wallet?</strong></p>\n<p>The primary user of Unstoppable Lite Wallet are people with domains.
