With more than 120 wallet apps, the sheer innovation in onboarding the next Billion users into web3 is surreal.</p>\n<p>Although wallets are expanding their utility from simply being a medium of secure storage and a facilitator of transactions to now, becoming a <em>‘Super Hub’</em> for NFT, DeFi, and app browsing activities, they still lack the ability to consistently relay updates and alerts between the user and the accessed protocol while maintaining a constant, symbiotic and duplex communication relationship.</p>\n<p>In addition, multi-chain wallets serve as a single entry point for users to interact with applications across a variety of supported chains with ease. However, there is no standardized way for these apps to communicate back with users through the same entrance point i.e. your wallet.</p>\n<h2 class=\"anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5\" id=\"solution\">Solution<a href=\"https://push.org/blog/how-wallets-use-push-to-become-a-super-app#solution\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Solution\" title=\"Direct link to Solution\">​</a></h2>\n<p><strong>Push helps us solve these challenges.</strong></p>\n<p>With the help of an open - decentralized and secure network supported across multiple chains, Push facilitates any wallet, DApp, service or smart contract to tap into the network and fetch notifications with ease.</p>\n<p>With the motive of forming a universal communication layer of web3, Push Protocol is expanding its support to multiple chains including <strong>Ethereum, Polygon, BSC, Arbitrum, Polygon zkEVM, Cyber and Fuse</strong>.</p>\n<p>To date, Push has sent over <strong>80 Million Notifications</strong> across <strong>230k+ subscribers</strong>.</p>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5\" id=\"journey-from-wallet-to-a-super-app-wallet-from-our-partners\">Journey from Wallet to a Super App Wallet from our Partners:<a href=\"https://push.org/blog/how-wallets-use-push-to-become-a-super-app#journey-from-wallet-to-a-super-app-wallet-from-our-partners\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Journey from Wallet to a Super App Wallet from our Partners:\" title=\"Direct link to Journey from Wallet to a Super App Wallet from our Partners:\">​</a></h3>\n<p>Lets take a thorough look at how our partner wallets are adopting Push to become a Super App.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Push enables interoperable communications\" src=\"https://push.org/assets/images/image1-773c84f6611fb60de497f032b88e6813.webp\" width=\"2226\" height=\"1248\" class=\"img_ev3q\"></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Push Metamask Snap</li>\n<li>Unstoppable Lite Wallet</li>\n<li>Shapeshift Governance Wallet</li>\n<li>Verso Wallet</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5\" id=\"1metamask-snap\">1.Metamask Snap:<a href=\"https://push.org/blog/how-wallets-use-push-to-become-a-super-app#1metamask-snap\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to 1.Metamask Snap:\" title=\"Direct link to 1.Metamask Snap:\">​</a></h3>\n<p>MetaMask Snaps are independent feature plugins developed by third-party developers to enhance wallet experiences in areas such as communication, interoperability, security, account management, and more, for various web3 protocols and applications.</p>\n<p>The Push MetaMask Snap allows users to receive real-time notification alerts from their favourite Web3 applications directly within their MetaMask wallet.</p>\n<p><strong>Push X Metamask: Unlocking a Super App experience:</strong></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Push Metamask Snap\" src=\"https://push.org/assets/images/image2-f60761f4c646a36f18c1ab5328f9657d.webp\" width=\"598\" height=\"1002\" class=\"img_ev3q\"></p>\n<p>Metamask being a widely popular wallet and often the first choice for many new web3 users, was crucial to integrate with Push’s capabilities.

How did you become involved in building in the blockchain space? What are you working on now?\">​</a></h3>\n<p>I have a research and crypto background.  I’ve been using digital currency in some form since I was 12 years old and was playing zynga poker on facebook selling chips for real money.</p>\n<p>I got into crypto shortly after, buying my first bitcoin on local bitcoins. I then got deeper and deeper into the tech and the finance side of it, developing arbitrage strategies. Did that across platforms and payment methods for a couple of years, and then started traveling the world and discovered cross-country strategies. Did a 300x during the 2021 bull run with delta neutral bets.</p>\n<p>I was also into writing at this time, and this Dutch art collective asked me to write an essay going into NFTs in detail about 3 years ago, during the research for it it hit me that this technology is perfect for digitizing ownership in real estate. So I started researching about how to make it happen alongside my job as a guest writer for India’s biggest crypto exchange WazirX, wrote the white paper for Estate Protocol, got some peers to review and advice, and then quit the job to build this full time. The business evolved way past using NFTs too.</p>\n<p>The time with Estate Protocol since then has been incredible. We tokenized the first properties in Dubai, and are working on many new innovations in the space.</p>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5\" id=\"tell-us-about-estate-protocol--whats-it-about-and-what-problem-does-it-solve\">Tell us about Estate Protocol — what’s it about and what problem does it solve?<a href=\"https://push.org/blog/estate-protocol-joins-frens-of-push#tell-us-about-estate-protocol--whats-it-about-and-what-problem-does-it-solve\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Tell us about Estate Protocol — what’s it about and what problem does it solve?\" title=\"Direct link to Tell us about Estate Protocol — what’s it about and what problem does it solve?\">​</a></h3>\n<p>Estate Protocol is changing the global real estate market by leveraging blockchain and UK trust law to tokenize assets, and stablecoins to facilitate seamless cross-border transactions. We tokenize the world’s most in demand real estate, fractionalize the ownership, and make it a part of DeFi in a compliant manner.

We reached new milestones and launched exciting initiatives. We sent out more than <strong>6 Million</strong> notifications in April reaching a cumulative <strong>74 Million notifications</strong> since the launch and 177K subscribers. The Push journey continues to gain momentum. Here’s a recap of what happened:</p>\n<h2 class=\"anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5\" id=\"product-updates\">Product Updates:<a href=\"https://push.org/blog/april-recap-blog-2024#product-updates\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Product Updates:\" title=\"Direct link to Product Updates:\">​</a></h2>\n<p>We've made significant strides in our development journey. We successfully deployed our <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pushprotocol/react-native-sdk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">React Native SDK</a> on NPM, simplifying the process for developers to access it. We've also rolled out improved notification settings on app stores, allowing for a more customized user experience.</p>\n<p>In our SDK, we introduced a new <strong>ChatWidget</strong> component and broadened our blockchain support to include <strong>Berachain</strong> and <strong>Polygon Amoy</strong>.</p>\n<p>Our website has been enhanced with a fresh landing page for the <a href=\"https://push.org/bootcamp/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Billion Reasons to Build (BRB) Bootcamp</a>, and we've enhanced the footer for smoother navigation.</p>\n<p>We're steadily advancing with new blockchain integrations that are currently under review. We've streamlined our channel addition process by separating it from IPFS, among other improvements. We're in the process of developing support for SCW wallets on our Push SDK.</p>\n<p>Our research on the Cross Chain Feature, which enables Ethereum and Layer 2 requests, has been completed and its development is underway. The <strong>Push Governance</strong> contract has been redesigned to align with the updated OpenZeppelin governance structure. We've managed to reduce the Smart Contract size by 30% and optimize gas fees for key functions like channel creation.</p>\n<h2 class=\"anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5\" id=\"partnership-updates\">Partnership Updates<a href=\"https://push.org/blog/april-recap-blog-2024#partnership-updates\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Partnership Updates\" title=\"Direct link to Partnership Updates\">​</a></h2>\n<p>We're thrilled to announce new partnerships with amazing projects including <a href=\"https://twitter.com/vurse_official/status/1782414484700533169\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Vurse</a>, <a href=\"https://www.rivo.xyz/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rivo</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pushprotocol/status/1778091601597960326\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Estate Protocol</a>, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pushprotocol/status/1780266671783194989\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pistachio Fi</a> to integrate notifications and messaging.

This week, we're joined by Roseon, a leading AI-powered cryptocurrency exchange.</p>\n<p>Roseon is the ultimate crypto ecosystem prioritizing user experience and gamification. It includes RoseonX, an AI-driven exchange with a modular architecture, and DeFi SuperApp, a one-stop mobile crypto app. With over 330K+ users and a global reach of 750K, it aims to boost crypto adoption and optimize investments.</p>\n<p>By way of this collaboration, Push helps Roseon keep its users in the loop by sending important updates like order executions &amp; liquidation directly to their wallets, <a href=\"http://app.push.org/channels/0xcBEBcCCF0B846C686D68c4D9EDA95fb17a7eedaE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">RoseonX Notification Channel</a>. Roseon is also working on adding Push notifications to RoseonX, so users can get updates right on the platform.</p>\n<p>In this episode of “Frens of Push”, Elle - Marketing Executive at Roseon joins us to talk about how the collaboration between Push and Roseon has the potential to change the way we communicate in web3.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Hi Elle, what’s your story? How did you become involved in building in the blockchain space? What are you working on now?</strong></p>\n<p>Hello everyone, this is Elle, and I work as Marketing Exec at Roseon. My fascination with blockchain and cryptography sparked in 2021, and it truly felt like stepping into a whole new world. Fast forward to today, and I’m thrilled to be part of the incredible team at Roseon. Who would've thought that my curiosity would lead me here? Life works in mysterious ways, doesn't it?</p>\n<p><strong>2. Tell us about Roseon Exchange — what’s it about and what problem does Roseon solve?</strong></p>\n<p>RoseonX is an AI-powered exchange with Modular Architecture. So, to give you the full story, it all started with the goal of bridging the gap between CeFi and DeFi, making crypto easily accessible. Our first mobile crypto app, RoseonApp, boasts over 300,000 registered users, with a peak of 20,000 daily active users. We were proud to be ranked among the Top 9 stars in BNB Chain Web3 Stars Accelerator Vietnam.</p>\n<p>Fueled by our visionary spirit, we made a strategic decision to pivot and delve into the development of our second product, RoseonX - initially a Gamified Derivatives DEX. Our approach embraces gamification, injecting a fresh level of engagement, fun, and excitement into crypto earning, trading, and DeFi in general. More recently, our whitepaper has evolved with the integration of AI, Copy Trading, and the Strategy Vault, transforming RoseonX into an AI Powered Exchange with Modular Architecture. This leap is geared towards enhancing the overall user experience in trading and other DeFi activities. Coupled with a friendly UI/UX, our aim is to drive mass adoption of our platform.</p>\n<p>We're thrilled about the direction RoseonX is taking, and we're excited to bring this innovative approach to the world of crypto and DeFi.</p>\n<p><strong>3. What’s the 2024 plan for Roseon Exchange and its ecosystem?</strong></p>\n<p>Our primary aim is to bring our new roadmap to life, complete with the AI Layer, Copy Trade, Strategy Vault, and more, as well as the official release of RoseonX.</p>\n<p><strong>4. How is the Roseon Exchange using Push’s web3 communication layer?</strong></p>\n<p>At present, RoseonX users stay informed about updates through the Push feature by opting into <a href=\"http://app.push.org/channels/0xcBEBcCCF0B846C686D68c4D9EDA95fb17a7eedaE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">RoseonX channels</a>. We're also in the process of integrating Push directly into RoseonX, allowing users to receive notifications right within our DEX.</p>\n<p><strong>5. How would you describe your experience using Push? What benefits have you seen?</strong></p>\n<p>We've had community members share how the Push feature has been really helpful for them, as it keeps them directly informed through their MetaMask wallet.</p>\n<p><strong>6. What cool use cases do you see Push being used for in the future?</strong></p>\n<p>I'm genuinely excited about the Push chat between wallets. It's such a cool feature, especially with all the functionalities like group chat, video calls, spaces, and streaming. This feature has the potential to bring a whole new level of interaction and convenience to users, and I can't wait to see it in action.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Thanks, Elle for the awesome conversation. Looking forward to revolutionizing web3 communication together with Roseon!</p>\n<p>Opt-in <a href=\"http://app.push.org/channels/0xcBEBcCCF0B846C686D68c4D9EDA95fb17a7eedaE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a> to get all the important updates from Roseon straightaway to your wallet 🔔👇</p>\n<p><strong>About RoseonX:</strong></p>\n<p>RoseonX is an AI-powered exchange with a modular architecture, providing multi-chain capabilities and AI tools like AI Trading Agent and AI Liquidity Agent.
