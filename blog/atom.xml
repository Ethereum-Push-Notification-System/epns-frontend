<p>Last week, we debuted Pre-PIP 3 (Push Improvement Proposal) for <a href="https://push.org/blog/cross-chain-requests-pre-pip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cross Chain Requests</a> on the <a href="https://gov.push.org/t/pre-pip-3-cross-chain-request-feature-in-push-smart-contracts-v3/1794" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Push DAO forum</a> and invited the <a href="https://wormhole.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wormhole</a> team to chat about it, since their tech is a major part of this upgrade.</p>
<p>Here’s a 3-minute recap for those who couldn’t join in:</p>
<p>We kicked off the <a href="https://x.com/pushprotocol/status/1819017203284578483" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spaces</a> with a bit of alpha on Push’s V3 Smart Contracts and what else is coming up from our side as the 2024 rolls on:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Launch of On-Chain Governance</strong>: The V3 contracts will introduce on-chain governance, allowing the community to govern smart contract execution.</li>
<li><strong>Optimized Contracts:</strong> Push’s V3 contracts will be more efficient. They’ll be capable of handling requests from any chain, which will then be relayed to the Ethereum-based Push core contracts for validations and state changes.</li>
<li><strong>Upgraded Incentivized Chats:</strong> Users will be able to initiate and receive paid chats from any chain to any chain, as long as both are supported by the framework.</li>
<li><strong>Cross-Chain Requests (CCR):</strong> This feature allows users to perform actions like creating channels or requests on any blockchain, rather than just on Ethereum. This move is essential for Push to reach a broader audience across different blockchains, including Layer 2 (L2), Layer 3 (L3), and app-specific chains, without increasing friction in the user’s experience with our tech.</li>
<li>A new hub for builders: All of this will enable a new hub for builders to experiment and widen the boundaries of innovation with web3-based consumer apps.</li>
</ol>
<p>We then moved on to Wormhole’s views on the significance of the integration of Push’s smart contracts with their tech:</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="why-push-x-wormhole">Why Push x Wormhole?<a href="https://push.org/blog/ama-with-wormhole-for-cross-chain-requests-pre-pip#why-push-x-wormhole" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why Push x Wormhole?" title="Direct link to Why Push x Wormhole?">​</a></h3>
<p>The integration centers on making the $PUSH token natively fungible across all of the connected chains that Push wants, while enabling native-messaging of all sorts on all involved. We came up with this new multi-chain framework, the Native Token Transfer framework, to enable seamless token transfers across different chains without the need for liquidity pools or complex bridging mechanisms. We both agree that the industry needs to involve into one that is truly interoperable. This is a major step in that direction.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="why-is-pre-pip-3ccr-important">Why is Pre-PIP 3/CCR important?<a href="https://push.org/blog/ama-with-wormhole-for-cross-chain-requests-pre-pip#why-is-pre-pip-3ccr-important" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why is Pre-PIP 3/CCR important?" title="Direct link to Why is Pre-PIP 3/CCR important?">​</a></h3>
<p>The proposal includes detailed research and considerations, focusing on minimal changes to the existing architecture, a security-first approach, and how the technical aspects of Wormhole will enable CCR. This includes the deployment of manager and transceiver contracts on different chains and how these contracts interact with Push’s existing infrastructure.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="why-did-push-choose-wormhole-for-this-integration">Why did Push choose Wormhole for this integration?<a href="https://push.org/blog/ama-with-wormhole-for-cross-chain-requests-pre-pip#why-did-push-choose-wormhole-for-this-integration" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why did Push choose Wormhole for this integration?" title="Direct link to Why did Push choose Wormhole for this integration?">​</a></h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Native Token Transfer (NTT) Framework:</strong> This framework allows for seamless token transfers across different chains without the need for liquidity pools or complex bridging mechanisms.</li>
<li><strong>Security:</strong> Wormhole’s framework is battle-tested and includes additional security measures like rate limiting.</li>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introducing Pre-PIP 3 (Push Improvement Proposal) for Cross-Chain Requests:]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Cover Image of Introducing Pre-PIP 3 (Push Improvement Proposal) for Cross-Chain Requests" src="https://push.org/assets/images/cover-image-57bca9ea6556a16c996e32f0d3721977.webp" width="1600" height="900" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Push Protocol, the leading web3 communication layer, has proposed a major upgrade with the introduction of <a href="https://gov.push.org/t/pre-pip-3-cross-chain-request-feature-in-push-smart-contracts-v3/1794" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pre-PIP (Push Improvement Proposal) for Cross-Chain Requests (CCR)</a>. This proposal aims to enable users to interact with Push Protocol smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain from any blockchain network, whether it’s EVM-based or non-EVM. Once CCR is implemented, users will be able to stay on their preferred blockchain while accessing Push Protocol's services, offering enhanced convenience and flexibility.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="what-is-ccr-cross-chain-requests-and-its-impact">What is CCR (Cross-Chain Requests) and its impact?<a href="https://push.org/blog/cross-chain-requests-pre-pip#what-is-ccr-cross-chain-requests-and-its-impact" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is CCR (Cross-Chain Requests) and its impact?" title="Direct link to What is CCR (Cross-Chain Requests) and its impact?">​</a></h3>
<p>In the current Push Protocol architecture, performing any important task related to channels like creating a channel, modification of a channel, changing a channel’s state, etc, requires the user/protocol to interact with the Push Smart Contract which is only deployed on Ethereum Blockchain.</p>
<p>This led to a bad user experience for the user/protocol as they need to switch to the Ethereum network for any interaction they might want to do with the Push Core contract. This is currently a friction point for users who primarily operate on other EVM-compatible chains and even non-EVM users.</p>
<p>Cross-chain requests will eliminate the need to switch to the Ethereum Network making it possible to create a channel, use Push services, or interact with Push Protocol’s Ethereum smart contract from any blockchain they like, whether it’s another EVM chain or non-EVM chain.</p>
<p>Additionally, this was not just something that users faced but more for Push Protocol as it limits Push Protocol's ability to tap into other chains and help solve the communication/notification issues of those chains adequately. This constraint hinders the protocol from reaching a broader audience and solving communication issues across diverse blockchain environments.</p>
<p>Therefore, by enabling the Cross-Chain Request feature, Push Protocol can primarily significantly enhance the UX for average users as well as channel creators/managers from not just Ethereum but multiple other EVM/Non-EVM chains as well. It also allows the protocol to expand its market reach, attract users from different chains, and foster a more interconnected blockchain ecosystem.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="importance-of-ccr-cross-chain-requests">Importance of CCR (Cross-Chain Requests):<a href="https://push.org/blog/cross-chain-requests-pre-pip#importance-of-ccr-cross-chain-requests" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Importance of CCR (Cross-Chain Requests):" title="Direct link to Importance of CCR (Cross-Chain Requests):">​</a></h3>
<p>The Cross Chain Requests (CCR) feature is crucial for the future success and growth of the Push Protocol:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Enhanced User Experience:</strong> The CCR feature will significantly enhance user experience by eliminating the need for users to switch networks or manually bridge tokens to interact with the Push Core contract on Ethereum. This streamlined process will allow users to perform key actions like channel creation and incentivize chat requests directly from their preferred blockchain, reducing both complexity and transaction costs. By making these features accessible from various chains, CCR removes barriers for new and existing users, fostering a more inclusive and user-friendly environment.</li>
<li><strong>Broader Reach:</strong> The CCR feature will expand the reach of Push Protocol across the blockchain ecosystem. By enabling interactions from multiple EVM and non-EVM chains, CCR will not only broaden the protocol's user base but also tap into diverse blockchain communities that might benefit from Push’s communication and notification features. This increased accessibility helps Push Protocol grow its market presence and integrate with a wider range of blockchain projects, ultimately supporting the development of a more interconnected and collaborative blockchain network.</li>
<li><strong>Revolutionizing Web3 Communications</strong>: CCR future-proofs Push Protocol against the rapid evolution of the blockchain space. As new chains and technologies emerge, CCR’s cross-chain capabilities ensure that Push Protocol remains adaptable and relevant. By leveraging established technologies like Wormhole’s NTT framework and Relayers, CCR positions Push Protocol to embrace future advancements and continue delivering value to its users across an ever-expanding blockchain landscape.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Here’s a simple overview of how CCR works:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Initiate Request</strong>: A user on another blockchain (like Polygon) wants to perform an action, such as creating a new channel for sending notifications.</li>
<li><strong>Submit Details</strong>: The user uses a special function on the Push Communicator contract on their preferred blockchain to submit the request, providing the necessary details and approving the $PUSH tokens for the action.</li>
<li><strong>Send Data and Tokens</strong>: The Push Communicator contract validates the input, creates a message payload, and uses Wormhole Relayers to securely send this payload and the $PUSH tokens to the Push Core contract on Ethereum.</li>
<li><strong>Process Request</strong>: On Ethereum, the Push Core contract receives the message and tokens, decodes the request, validates it, and performs the required action.</li>
<li><strong>Completion</strong>: The request is completed on Ethereum, and any unused native tokens are refunded to the user on their original blockchain.</li>
</ol>

<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="visualizing-channel-creation-with-the-ccr-feature">Visualizing Channel Creation with the CCR feature<a href="https://push.org/blog/cross-chain-requests-pre-pip#visualizing-channel-creation-with-the-ccr-feature" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Visualizing Channel Creation with the CCR feature" title="Direct link to Visualizing Channel Creation with the CCR feature">​</a></h3>
<p>Imagine Bob, a Polygon user, wants to create a channel for sending notifications.</p>
<p>Previously, he'd need to switch to Ethereum, bridge tokens, and change networks. With CCR, Bob simply uses the familiar Push Communicator contract on Polygon.</p>
<p>The contract acts as a bridge, relaying Bob's request (channel details) and the required PUSH tokens (bridged via Wormhole) to the Push Core contract on Ethereum.</p>
<p>All behind the scenes, without Bob ever leaving Polygon! This creates a seamless experience for users on any chain, opening Push Protocol to a wider audience.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="why-not-just-deploy-push-core-everywhere">Why Not Just Deploy Push Core Everywhere?<a href="https://push.org/blog/cross-chain-requests-pre-pip#why-not-just-deploy-push-core-everywhere" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why Not Just Deploy Push Core Everywhere?" title="Direct link to Why Not Just Deploy Push Core Everywhere?">​</a></h3>
<p>While putting Push Core on every blockchain might seem easy, it's quite tricky.</p>
<p>It would be hard to manage separate fees and keep all the information on different chains in sync, which could even be risky.</p>
<p>That's why we're improving the existing Push Communicator contracts to handle these requests. We'll also use a reliable system called Wormhole to securely send information and tokens between blockchains. This way, everything works smoothly without needing Push Core on every chain.

<p>To implement Cross-Chain Requests (CCR), we will:</p>
<ol>
<li>Enable $Push Token for multi-chain support.</li>
<li>Build cross-chain support in the Push Communicator and Push Core Contract.</li>
<li>Use Wormhole’s Relayer Interface and NTT framework for token transfers across chains.</li>
<li>Equip the Push Communicator to handle cross-chain actions like channel creation and requests.</li>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Moving across an open web with Push]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Cover image of Case Study - Moving across an open web with Push" src="https://push.org/assets/images/cover-image-c9dfc8a9752992a8c97ecf5c76e0095e.webp" width="1600" height="900" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>With every passing day, the blockchain industry continues to become more mature and inch closer towards achieving the operational level comfort that today’s web2 world offers.</p>
<p>In this pursuit, we’re witnessing a period of massive experimentation in on-chain infrastructure design.</p>
<p>A natural trend observed in the EVM space is vertical growth through Rollups, Layer 2, and Layer 3 networks. The common goal of this design shift is to achieve scalability and, as a result, a higher degree of interoperability.</p>
<p>But as the web3 dev community continues to take bigger strides in achieving transactional interoperability, app-to-user, app-to-app, and user-to-user communication are still at nascent steps.</p>
<p>Push is working towards diminishing this divide between transactional and communication interoperability by building a robust, secure fabric that weaves multiple chains and services together by forming the <strong>“Universal Layer2 Of Communication”</strong>.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="fragmented-ecosystem">Fragmented Ecosystem<a href="https://push.org/blog/interoperable-communications-moving-across-an-open-web-with-push#fragmented-ecosystem" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Fragmented Ecosystem" title="Direct link to Fragmented Ecosystem">​</a></h2>
<p>Web3 operates on a multitude of blockchains, each with its own protocols, standards, and its own unique set of rules. This creates independent and isolated silos of information, making it difficult for users, services and applications built on separate chains to interact and communicate with each other unanimously.</p>
<p>Push continues to form a communication blanket over the fragmented ecosystem and provide its communication services to multiple EVM and non-EVM based chains. At present, Push supports over 7 networks including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ethereum</li>
<li>Polyogn</li>
<li>Polygon zkEVM</li>
<li>Arbitrum</li>
<li>Binance Smart Chain (BNB)</li>
<li>Fuse</li>
<li>Cyber</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Communicator contracts (Push Comm V2) serve as a middleware for listening to inbound communications</strong>&nbsp;and events from the Client Application’s smart contract. Thus, shouldering the responsibility of on-chain communication across contracts deployed on multiple chains (EVM and non-EVM).</p>
<p>Notifications can not always be triggered as a result of an on-chain event. Many notifications, especially the ones that are more inclined towards driving engagement can be considered off-chain. Push ensures that any frontend, service, backend or smart contract can easily send communication payloads across the diverse participants and devices ( App, Wallet, Extension, Frontends and more).</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="data-availability-no-communication-da-layer">Data Availability (no communication DA layer)<a href="https://push.org/blog/interoperable-communications-moving-across-an-open-web-with-push#data-availability-no-communication-da-layer" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Data Availability (no communication DA layer)" title="Direct link to Data Availability (no communication DA layer)">​</a></h2>
<p>Traditionally, Data Availability (DA) ensures that the data needed to validate a block is accessible to the majority of network participants. However, in the context of interoperable communications within Web3, we need a broader concept: “<strong>Communication DA”</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>What's the problem?</strong>
From an end user's perspective, app notifications and other forms of read-write communications (messaging, groupchats, videocalls) should be accessible regardless of the platform, service, hardware and underlying chain they use.  Previously, there was no standardized middleware mechanism to link communication across platforms and chains.</p>
<p>Push solves this problem. Being an open network, Push enables any frontend, service, or backend to securely tap into the Push network and extract the necessary communication payloads in a platform-agnostic manner.</p>
<p>Simply put, <strong>your communication travels with your web3 identity: your wallet.</strong></p>

<p>In a typical web3 user journey, A user’s wallet , is the first element that unlocks transactional interoperability by  allowing users to seamlessly transfer assets and interact with dApps regardless of their underlying set of rules.</p>
<p>Push Protocol extends the scope of this interoperability by  enabling cross-chain communication in form of notifications and messaging for Dapps, wallets, and services by tying it to the wallet addresses in an open, cryptographically encrypted and gasless manner.</p>
<p>Notifications from various protocols and services are accessible regardless of the chains they originate from. All subscribed channel notifications are synchronized and displayed in one place within your Push-compatible wallet.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://dappradar.com/blog/state-of-the-dapp-industry-q1-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DApp Radar</a>, Q1 2024 saw a remarkable surge in daily active wallet users (dUAW), reaching an average of 7 million daily active wallets—a 77% increase compared to the previous year.</p>
<p>The numbers clearly show that the entry into web3 starts from a wallet. With more than 120 wallet apps in market, Push presents an opportunity to revolutionise their UX by reaching to these wallet addresses. And essentially pave the way to <strong>onboard the first Billion users into web3</strong>.</p>
<p>Protocols, services, and DApps can tap into a highly scalable  distribution stream with the help of Push. Push ties all application-specific communication to the user's wallet address, ensuring zero user friction and exponentially growing the client protocol's distribution.</p>

<p>With respect to communications, decentralization can be broken down into:</p>
<ol>
<li>Immutability of communication payloads/messages</li>
<li>Inability to censor content.</li>
</ol>
<p>Push maintains immutability and censorship resistance  by encrypting mission critical communication payloads and messaging chats ensuring highest standards of communication security.</p>

<p>We believe communications is a public good and a bare necessity for a frictionless digital life.
This also means that the means to provide communications and access them should not be limited to one or atmost two mediums.</p>
<p>Push invented the communication network for web3 with a similar vision of enabling communication experiences unconstrained by chains.</p>
<p><strong>A user of chain 'X' should not only be able to communicate with other users and services on that chain but also with users and services on chain 'Y' seamlessly, without added friction.</strong></p>
<p>This is how Push is pushing towards forming a universal communication network of web3 encompassing all networks ensuring you, as a user can move across the open web along with your communications with ease.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Cover image of blog - How to create your community on Push Chat?" src="https://push.org/assets/images/cover-image-db4e91147bf978f668cf712539292325.webp" width="1600" height="900" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Creating your on-chain community on Push Protocol is fairly easy.</p>
<p>This guide will walk you through the step by step process of creating your own vibrant community on Push Protocol, right from setting up a strong foundation to complete community formation.</p>
<p>To illustrate the journey, lets imagine a community dedicated to a captivating NFT collection known as '<strong>Charcoal Cats🐱</strong>'. In this guide we will show you, how to create a conditionally gated group chat exclusively for these Charcoal Cats admirers.</p>
<p>Building a strong online community takes more than just setting up a group chat.
Before diving in to the group creation process, let's explore some key considerations to form a solid foundation of your community.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="1define-your-communitys-purpose">1.Define your community's purpose<a href="https://push.org/blog/how-to-create-your-community-on-push-chat#1define-your-communitys-purpose" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1.Define your community's purpose" title="Direct link to 1.Define your community's purpose">​</a></h3>
<p>Members join and leave the communities, but what remains constant is the community's  purpose.
Find out what common interests will unite your members?<br>
<!-- -->For Example : The 'Charcoal Cats🐱' community is cult camp of charcoal cat NFT lovers. The access to the chat is restricted to only those wallets who hold 'Charcoal Cats' NFT/s.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="2choose-your-community-type">2.Choose your community type<a href="https://push.org/blog/how-to-create-your-community-on-push-chat#2choose-your-community-type" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2.Choose your community type" title="Direct link to 2.Choose your community type">​</a></h3>
<p>Do you prefer a community which is more welcoming, open &amp; visible to all (i.e Public Group Chats) or rather prefer to form a exclusive community which is only visible to the individuals who are invited, are a part of the community or satisfy the criteria to join it.</p>
<p>Push enables both, Public and Private communities with the ability to establish gating conditions for <strong>controlled access</strong>.</p>
<p>With respect to our  example, lets  keep the Charcoal Cats a private community where-in the messages are encrypted and only visible upon successfully joining the group.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="3decide-open-to-all-or-conditionally-gated-group-chat">3.Decide: Open to all OR Conditionally Gated Group Chat<a href="https://push.org/blog/how-to-create-your-community-on-push-chat#3decide-open-to-all-or-conditionally-gated-group-chat" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 3.Decide: Open to all OR Conditionally Gated Group Chat" title="Direct link to 3.Decide: Open to all OR Conditionally Gated Group Chat">​</a></h3>
<p>Groupchats that do not impose any pre-requsite condition before joining the group can be termed as <strong>open groupchats</strong>.
For instance, media oriented groupchats can be joined by anyone directly.</p>
<p><strong>Conditionally Gated Chats</strong></p>
<p>Group chats that impose one or multiple conditions for users and allows only those users who satisfy these conditions are termed as <strong>conditionally gated chats</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Conditions are a series of criterias that can be applied for both, joining the group as well as for chatting in the group.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>'Any' setting:</strong> Here, users only need to meet one of the defined criteria to gain access. This allows for a more inclusive approach.</li>
<li><strong>'All' setting:</strong> This requires users to satisfy all the defined criteria, creating a more exclusive space.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the ever-evolving landscape of Web3, as protocols become more innovative and mature, the need for web3 wallets to act as a bridge for onboarding typical Internet (web2) users into web3 with minimal friction is advancing rapidly.</p>
<p>Amidst these technical advancements, communication remains a paramount factor in driving this transformation.</p>
<p>Today, Push Protocol is at the forefront, enabling wallets to enhance their functionality and better serve their users by becoming a <strong>'Super App’</strong>.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="challenges">Challenges<a href="https://push.org/blog/how-wallets-use-push-to-become-a-super-app#challenges" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Challenges" title="Direct link to Challenges">​</a></h2>
<p>According to <a href="https://dappradar.com/blog/state-of-the-dapp-industry-q1-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DApp Radar</a>, Q1 2024 saw a remarkable surge in daily active wallet users (dUAW), reaching an average of <strong>7 million</strong> daily active wallets—a <strong>77%</strong> increase compared to the previous year.</p>
<p>The numbers clearly show that the entry into web3 starts from a wallet. With more than 120 wallet apps, the sheer innovation in onboarding the next Billion users into web3 is surreal.</p>
<p>Although wallets are expanding their utility from simply being a medium of secure storage and a facilitator of transactions to now, becoming a <em>‘Super Hub’</em> for NFT, DeFi, and app browsing activities, they still lack the ability to consistently relay updates and alerts between the user and the accessed protocol while maintaining a constant, symbiotic and duplex communication relationship.</p>
<p>In addition, multi-chain wallets serve as a single entry point for users to interact with applications across a variety of supported chains with ease. However, there is no standardized way for these apps to communicate back with users through the same entrance point i.e. your wallet.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="solution">Solution<a href="https://push.org/blog/how-wallets-use-push-to-become-a-super-app#solution" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Solution" title="Direct link to Solution">​</a></h2>
<p><strong>Push helps us solve these challenges.</strong></p>
<p>With the help of an open - decentralized and secure network supported across multiple chains, Push facilitates any wallet, DApp, service or smart contract to tap into the network and fetch notifications with ease.</p>
<p>With the motive of forming a universal communication layer of web3, Push Protocol is expanding its support to multiple chains including <strong>Ethereum, Polygon, BSC, Arbitrum, Polygon zkEVM, Cyber and Fuse</strong>.</p>
<p>To date, Push has sent over <strong>80 Million Notifications</strong> across <strong>230k+ subscribers</strong>.</p>

<p>Push is proud to enable the next frontier of inter-domain communication by powering notifications and messaging support for over <strong>3.58 million</strong> UD users across more than <strong>300 group chats</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>How does Push fit into the overall strategic goals of Unstoppable Lite Wallet?</strong></p>
<p>Messaging is built directly into Unstoppable Lite Wallet. Push Protocol enables token gated group chat. Messaging is built directly into Unstoppable Lite Wallet.</p>

<p><strong>Overcoming seed phrase scares using MPC</strong></p>
<p>The unstoppable lite wallet features advanced multi-party computation (MPC) technology provided by Fireblocks to improve safety for the self-custody wallet. Users are able to manage their wallet using an email address and password, instead of worrying about seed phrases. There is also a way to recover the wallet if the user forgets their password, adding another layer of safety.</p>

<p>To all the builders and 1.6M active wallets on <a href="https://arbitrum.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Arbitrum</a>, get ready – because we've arrived!</p>
<p>Bringing with us our full suite of web3-native communication tools: <a href="https://push.org/docs/notifications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Push Notifications</a>, <a href="https://push.org/docs/chat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chat</a>, <a href="https://push.org/docs/chat/build/create-group/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Custom Gated Group Chat</a> to enhance the user experience on Arbitrum.</p>
<p>We're absolutely thrilled to be leading a new era of decentralized communication within one of the fastest-growing blockchains in web3 and can’t wait to see the all-new usability, multi-communication interoperability, and dApp user-experience enhancements that are already on the way. Leveraging the power of Arbitrum's scalable, fast, and secure Layer 2 solutions, Push notifications enable real-time alerts for various blockchain activities such as transaction confirmations, governance proposals, DeFi updates, and NFT drops.</p>
<p>So what else is there to know and get excited about? Let’s dive in.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="arbitrum-x-push-protocol---revolutionizing-decentralized-interaction">Arbitrum x Push Protocol - Revolutionizing Decentralized Interaction<a href="https://push.org/blog/push-protocol-on-arbitrum-blockchain#arbitrum-x-push-protocol---revolutionizing-decentralized-interaction" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Arbitrum x Push Protocol - Revolutionizing Decentralized Interaction" title="Direct link to Arbitrum x Push Protocol - Revolutionizing Decentralized Interaction">​</a></h3>
<p>Since our mainnet launch in January 2022, Push has emerged as the go-to communication layer for over 700+ of the world's leading dApps on <a href="https://ethereum.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ethereum</a>, <a href="https://polygon.technology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polygon</a>, <a href="https://www.bnbchain.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BNB Chain</a>, <a href="https://polygon.technology/polygon-zkevm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polygon zkEVM</a>, <a href="https://linea.build/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Linea</a> and other blockchains.</p>
<p>Now, we’re expanding our privacy-centric communication product suite to the leading Layer 2 scaling solution on Ethereum, Arbitrum. With over <a href="https://www.ccn.com/news/crypto/ethereum-l2-arbitrum-base/#:~:text=It%20boasts%20a%20market%20share,a%20TVL%20of%20%247.93b." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">45.1% of the Ethereum Layer-2</a> market share and a TVL of over $15.42 Billion – Arbitrum provides some of the best tools for building scalable dApps on Ethereum and has an incredibly active user-base (with 971M in total DeFi transactions across 1.6M active wallets as of June 2024).</p>
<p>As such, what makes this integration so exciting is the potential utility and enhancement possibilities. Leveraging Push Notifications, Chat, and Video, we look forward to integrating with leading Arbitrum dApps to enhance how dApps and users interact.</p>
<p>The best part of our integration: multi-chain communication. As we continue to expand our blockchain integrations, we open the door to better interoperability between users on different chains. This enhanced user-experience means fewer compromises in the way of interaction and engagement for users, and as a result, better adoption and user-stickiness. All this utility is driven by the communication infrastructure of Push Protocol.</p>
