        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Cover Image of Roseon - Leading AI-Powered Exchange Joins Frens Of Push  " src="https://push.org/assets/images/cover-image-f43e64038e2aa7af918d0786b0b08ae5.webp" width="1600" height="900" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Welcome back to "Frens of Push‚Äù- a deep dive into the top protocols and Push ecosystem partners. This week, we're joined by Roseon, a leading AI-powered cryptocurrency exchange.</p>
<p>Roseon is the ultimate crypto ecosystem prioritizing user experience and gamification. It includes RoseonX, an AI-driven exchange with a modular architecture, and DeFi SuperApp, a one-stop mobile crypto app. With over 330K+ users and a global reach of 750K, it aims to boost crypto adoption and optimize investments.</p>
<p>By way of this collaboration, Push helps Roseon keep its users in the loop by sending important updates like order executions &amp; liquidation directly to their wallets, <a href="http://app.push.org/channels/0xcBEBcCCF0B846C686D68c4D9EDA95fb17a7eedaE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RoseonX Notification Channel</a>. Roseon is also working on adding Push notifications to RoseonX, so users can get updates right on the platform.</p>
<p>In this episode of ‚ÄúFrens of Push‚Äù, Elle - Marketing Executive at Roseon joins us to talk about how the collaboration between Push and Roseon has the potential to change the way we communicate in web3.</p>
<p><strong>1. Hi Elle, what‚Äôs your story? How did you become involved in building in the blockchain space? What are you working on now?</strong></p>
<p>Hello everyone, this is Elle, and I work as Marketing Exec at Roseon. My fascination with blockchain and cryptography sparked in 2021, and it truly felt like stepping into a whole new world. Fast forward to today, and I‚Äôm thrilled to be part of the incredible team at Roseon. Who would've thought that my curiosity would lead me here? Life works in mysterious ways, doesn't it?</p>
<p><strong>2. Tell us about Roseon Exchange ‚Äî what‚Äôs it about and what problem does Roseon solve?</strong></p>
<p>RoseonX is an AI-powered exchange with Modular Architecture. So, to give you the full story, it all started with the goal of bridging the gap between CeFi and DeFi, making crypto easily accessible. Our first mobile crypto app, RoseonApp, boasts over 300,000 registered users, with a peak of 20,000 daily active users. We were proud to be ranked among the Top 9 stars in BNB Chain Web3 Stars Accelerator Vietnam.</p>
<p>Fueled by our visionary spirit, we made a strategic decision to pivot and delve into the development of our second product, RoseonX - initially a Gamified Derivatives DEX. Our approach embraces gamification, injecting a fresh level of engagement, fun, and excitement into crypto earning, trading, and DeFi in general. More recently, our whitepaper has evolved with the integration of AI, Copy Trading, and the Strategy Vault, transforming RoseonX into an AI Powered Exchange with Modular Architecture. This leap is geared towards enhancing the overall user experience in trading and other DeFi activities. Coupled with a friendly UI/UX, our aim is to drive mass adoption of our platform.</p>
<p>We're thrilled about the direction RoseonX is taking, and we're excited to bring this innovative approach to the world of crypto and DeFi.</p>
<p><strong>3. What‚Äôs the 2024 plan for Roseon Exchange and its ecosystem?</strong></p>
<p>Our primary aim is to bring our new roadmap to life, complete with the AI Layer, Copy Trade, Strategy Vault, and more, as well as the official release of RoseonX.</p>
<p><strong>4. How is the Roseon Exchange using Push‚Äôs web3 communication layer?</strong></p>
<p>At present, RoseonX users stay informed about updates through the Push feature by opting into <a href="http://app.push.org/channels/0xcBEBcCCF0B846C686D68c4D9EDA95fb17a7eedaE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RoseonX channels</a>. We're also in the process of integrating Push directly into RoseonX, allowing users to receive notifications right within our DEX.</p>
<p><strong>5. How would you describe your experience using Push? What benefits have you seen?</strong></p>
<p>We've had community members share how the Push feature has been really helpful for them, as it keeps them directly informed through their MetaMask wallet.</p>
<p><strong>6. What cool use cases do you see Push being used for in the future?</strong></p>
<p>I'm genuinely excited about the Push chat between wallets. It's such a cool feature, especially with all the functionalities like group chat, video calls, spaces, and streaming. This feature has the potential to bring a whole new level of interaction and convenience to users, and I can't wait to see it in action.</p>
<hr>
<p>Thanks, Elle for the awesome conversation. Looking forward to revolutionizing web3 communication together with Roseon!</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Cover Image of How Push Protocol Helps Build Thriving NFT and DeFi Communities Using Push Group Chats Blog " src="https://push.org/assets/images/cover-image-f9f5895933518cea811176b969e8d1bf.webp" width="1600" height="900" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>The NFT and DeFi landscapes are hotbeds of innovation but building a loyal and engaged community around your project can be a challenge. Traditional communication methods often fall short, leaving users scattered across different platforms and lacking a true sense of belonging.</p>
<p>Enter <strong>Push Protocol Group Chat</strong>, a revolutionary tool that empowers NFT brands and DeFi protocols to cultivate thriving communities through secure, token-gated experiences.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="benefits-of-token-gated-chats">Benefits of Token-Gated Chats<a href="https://push.org/blog/how-push-protocol-helps-build-thriving-nft-and-defi#benefits-of-token-gated-chats" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Benefits of Token-Gated Chats" title="Direct link to Benefits of Token-Gated Chats">‚Äã</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Enhanced Engagement:</strong>&nbsp;Exclusive access creates a sense of value and incentivizes deeper participation within the community.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Stronger Brand Loyalty:</strong>&nbsp;Token-gated chats foster a sense of belonging and exclusivity, strengthening the bond between users and your project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Targeted Communication:</strong>&nbsp;Connect directly with your most engaged user base, ensuring your message reaches the right audience.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Unstoppable Domains: Powering Communities with Human-Readable Addresses:</strong></p>
<p>Push Protocol seamlessly integrates with <a href="https://unstoppabledomains.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unstoppable Domains (UD)</a>. This allows users to join group chats using their UD (e.g., yourname.nft) instead of complex wallet addresses. This enhances user experience and makes it easier for new members to join the conversation.</p>
<p><strong>Taking it a Step Further: Gated Roles with Guild.xyz:</strong></p>
<p>Push Protocol's partnership with <a href="https://guild.xyz/explorer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Guild.xyz</a> unlocks even more possibilities for community management. You can now leverage Guild roles to create additional access tiers within your token-gated chat.</p>
<p>Imagine offering exclusive channels within your main chat, accessible only to users with specific Guild roles (e.g., early adopters, high-volume traders). This allows you to tailor the chat experience to different user segments and cater to their unique needs.</p>
<p><strong>Examples in Action:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A limited-edition NFT collection can create a token-gated chat where holders can discuss upcoming collaborations and access exclusive artwork previews.</li>
</ul>
<p>Similar to the <a href="https://twitter.com/pushprotocol/status/1777929898784444842?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=amplify_upgrade" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pudgy Penguin's Unstopabble Domains token gated group chat</a> powered by Push Protocol, where only Pudgy Penguin Hodlers can join and communicate with each other and share their sense of community pride!</p>
<ul>
<li>A DeFi platform like <a href="https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Curve</a> can offer a tiered chat system, with basic access for all token holders and a dedicated channel for high-level stakers to discuss governance proposals and advanced strategies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Push Protocol empowers NFT brands and DeFi protocols to build vibrant, engaged communities that drive long-term success. By fostering a sense of exclusivity, targeted communication, and deeper connections, Push Protocol unlocks the true potential of Web3 communities.</p>

<p>We're back with Frens of Push, offering a deep dive into the top protocols and Push ecosystem partners. This week, our fren is QuickSwap, the leading DEX &amp; AMM on Polygon.</p>
<p>QuickSwap is the leading DEX on Polygon PoS, Polygon zkEVM, and Dogechain that‚Äôs fully decentralized and community-driven, building a comprehensive suite of DeFi products called the DragonFi ecosystem. It‚Äôs renowned for its high-performance, cost-efficient DeFi platforms, and pioneering role in onboarding new users and capital to the broader Polygon ecosystem.</p>
<p>By way of this collaboration, Push provides QuickSwap with the infrastructure to facilitate its users by alerting users to swap events and changing token prices, as well as for V3 liquidity alerts. QuickSwap relies on Push‚Äôs communication layer to deliver in-app notifications while ensuring a decentralized relay and storage.</p>
<p>In this episode of ‚ÄúFrens of Push‚Äù, Roc, Founder <a href="https://twitter.com/QuickSwapDEX" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@QuickSwapDEX</a>, joins us to talk about how the collaboration between Push and QuickSwap has the potential to disrupt web3 communication.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="hi-roc-whats-your-story-how-did-you-become-involved-in-building-in-the-blockchain-space-what-are-you-working-on-now">Hi Roc, what‚Äôs your story? How did you become involved in building in the blockchain space? What are you working on now?<a href="https://push.org/blog/quickswap-joins-frens-of-push#hi-roc-whats-your-story-how-did-you-become-involved-in-building-in-the-blockchain-space-what-are-you-working-on-now" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Hi Roc, what‚Äôs your story? How did you become involved in building in the blockchain space? What are you working on now?" title="Direct link to Hi Roc, what‚Äôs your story? How did you become involved in building in the blockchain space? What are you working on now?">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p><b>Roc:</b> I‚Äôve been around the Web3 space for a long time ‚Äì since the early days of both Bitcoin and Ethereum. As a libertarian, Bitcoin was my first love so to speak. As an elegant solution to an age-old monetary dilemma that has plagued humanity, I was on board and extremely interested right away.</p>
<p>However, as the Web3 industry has grown and evolved around Bitcoin, my interests have evolved as well in the years since I discovered Bitcoin. Today, I see the power of decentralized systems as being capable of resolving far more problems than just sound money. The power of decentralized finance to free up dormant capital, vastly improve capital efficiency, and provide individuals across the world with a more level playing field and opportunities to invest and capitalize on their skills excites me very much.</p>
<p>Today, I am leading Lunar Digital Assets (LDA), a premier marketing agency and incubator that helps rising Web3 projects to get the most out of their technology. We specialize in brand building, narrative formation, and effective marketing strategies. QuickSwap is one of our long-time clients, and we go way back with the team at Polygon Labs, too. At LDA, We see a great deal of promise in the ecosystem being developed in Polygon 2.0, and we are positioning QuickSwap to be a key player in all things Polygon DeFi. Keep an eye on us!</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="tell-us-about-quickswap--whats-it-about-and-what-problem-does-quickswap-solve">Tell us about QuickSwap ‚Äî what‚Äôs it about and what problem does QuickSwap solve?<a href="https://push.org/blog/quickswap-joins-frens-of-push#tell-us-about-quickswap--whats-it-about-and-what-problem-does-quickswap-solve" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Tell us about QuickSwap ‚Äî what‚Äôs it about and what problem does QuickSwap solve?" title="Direct link to Tell us about QuickSwap ‚Äî what‚Äôs it about and what problem does QuickSwap solve?">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p><b>Roc:</b> QuickSwap is the premier DeFi suite on Polygon, bar none. Since the infamous 2020 DeFi wave, QuickSwap has been committed to providing Web3 users of all demographics with the simplest, most intuitive user experience possible. On this accord, QuickSwap has served as an evangelizing force for Polygon‚Äôs scalability stack, in the mission to drive down costs and transaction times. More recently, QuickSwap has acted as a first mover deploying on Polygon‚Äôs latest high-performance chain, zkEVM as well.</p>
<p>With QuickSwap, whether you‚Äôre looking to swap, stake, and farm on a lightning-fast DEX or trade high-stakes perpetual contracts, you know you‚Äôre going to get the best of everything. The latest features, the slickest user experience, the lowest fees, and of course, true decentralization. Between the QuickSwap DAO‚Äôs governance votes and discussions, and Polygon‚Äôs decentralized architecture, users no longer have to choose between high-performance decentralized systems and user-friendly UIs ‚Äì with QuickSwap, it‚Äôs the best of everything, all in one place.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="how-do-developers-use-quickswap">How do developers use QuickSwap?<a href="https://push.org/blog/quickswap-joins-frens-of-push#how-do-developers-use-quickswap" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How do developers use QuickSwap?" title="Direct link to How do developers use QuickSwap?">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p><b>Roc:</b> Developers are free and welcome to explore QuickSwap‚Äôs documentation and to connect with the team to send in suggestions, new ideas, and business development proposals. QuickSwap has been integrating new technologies on a monthly basis for years now ‚Äì not to mention integrating QuickSwap‚Äôs platforms on new and rising Polygon CDK chains. For the technical folks out there, go right ahead and check out <a href="https://github.com/QuickSwap/quickswap-docs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">QuickSwap‚Äôs GitHub</a>.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="whats-the-2024-plan-for-quickswap-and-its-ecosystem">What‚Äôs the 2024 plan for QuickSwap and its ecosystem?<a href="https://push.org/blog/quickswap-joins-frens-of-push#whats-the-2024-plan-for-quickswap-and-its-ecosystem" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What‚Äôs the 2024 plan for QuickSwap and its ecosystem?" title="Direct link to What‚Äôs the 2024 plan for QuickSwap and its ecosystem?">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p><b>Roc:</b> I‚Äôm glad you asked! QuickSwap released its plans for DragonFi 2.0 in December 2023, and I have to say: that the project has been delivering right on schedule. QuickSwap‚Äôs DragonFi 2.0 initiative focuses on deploying the QuickSwap DeFi suite ‚Äì a QuickSwap Citadel, as it‚Äôs called ‚Äì to as many newly arriving Polygon CDK (Chain Development Kit) chains as possible. The mission is simple: to become the dominant DeFi force on Polygon 2.0, and eventually, to conquer the entire Web3 DeFi scene as the go-to homebase for ultra-high-performance, ultra-low-cost, ultra-liquid‚Ä¶.well, you get it.</p>
<p>This year, QuickSwap has stayed true to its word, deploying Citadels on a number of new Polygon chains, including zkAstar, Immutable zkEVM, and Manta Pacific. The movement is underway, and QuickSwap‚Äôs user base and key metrics are growing every week.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="how-is-quickswap-using-pushs-web3-communication-layer">How is QuickSwap using Push‚Äôs web3 communication layer?<a href="https://push.org/blog/quickswap-joins-frens-of-push#how-is-quickswap-using-pushs-web3-communication-layer" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How is QuickSwap using Push‚Äôs web3 communication layer?" title="Direct link to How is QuickSwap using Push‚Äôs web3 communication layer?">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p><b>Roc:</b> At present, QuickSwap is using the Push communication layer to alert users as to swap events, and changing token prices, as well as for V3 liquidity alerts ‚Äì for instance, when a user‚Äôs liquidity falls out of range.</p>
<p>But there‚Äôs a lot more in the works and on the way. Already, QuickSwap has plans to leverage the Push communication layer to keep users informed with a range of new notifications, including those related to perpetual contracts, limit order and TWAP limit order execution, new farm and bond deployment, and the conclusion and closure of various farming opportunities. There‚Äôs a lot to look forward to in the world of QuickSwap ‚Äì thanks to the whole team over at Push.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="how-would-you-describe-your-experience-using-push-what-benefits-have-you-seen">How would you describe your experience using Push?

What benefits have you seen?" title="Direct link to How would you describe your experience using Push? What benefits have you seen?">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p><b>Roc:</b> Above all, Push is super user-friendly and intuitive. As a project fully committed to delivering a best-in-class user experience, QuickSwap is of the opinion that using Web3 ecosystems should be as simple as possible. Otherwise, onboarding ain‚Äôt happening. On that thread, setting up notifications should be just as easy as receiving them. Thankfully, Push has absolutely nailed it in the communications department and is setting up a much-needed set of communications tooling and services.</p>
<p>For QuickSwap, that means improving user experience for traders is easier than ever before ‚Äì you might call it the best user experience experience on the market!</p>

<p><b>Roc:</b> As the world continues to migrate to the on-chain domain, notifications will become absolutely necessary built-in features ‚Äì especially for Layer 1 transactions that necessarily involve some degree of latency. Transaction confirmations aren‚Äôt the only examples ‚Äì as SocialFi expands, on-chain identity tooling picks up traction, and payment rails integrate digital assets, notifications will become essential for users to utilize decentralized systems and their native assets with confidence. Push is standing at the very frontier of digital innovation ‚Äì right alongside QuickSwap, that is!</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Revolutionising Communication for DeFi and NFT Brands with Push!]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Cover Image of Revolutionising Communication for DeFi and NFT Brands with Push " src="https://push.org/assets/images/cover-image-aa62458a193c0aebdadb58509a209af4.webp" width="1600" height="900" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>The decentralized revolution is upon us, with DeFi (Decentralized Finance) and NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) leading the charge. However, fostering strong communication and community engagement in these fast-paced ecosystems can be a challenge.</p>
<p><a href="https://push.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Push Protocol</a> emerges as a game-changer, offering a secure and scalable solution for DeFi and NFT brands to connect with their user base effectively. Let's delve into how Push Protocol empowers these brands in two key areas: sending notifications and managing communities.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="seamless-notification-delivery">Seamless Notification Delivery:<a href="https://push.org/blog/revolutionising-communication-for-defi-and-nft-with-push#seamless-notification-delivery" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Seamless Notification Delivery:" title="Direct link to Seamless Notification Delivery:">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>Gone are the days of unreliable social media notifications and clunky email lists. Push Protocol enables DeFi and NFT brands to deliver real-time, secure notifications directly to users' crypto wallets. This ensures critical updates, price fluctuations, governance proposals, and exclusive announcements reach your audience instantly.</p>
<p><strong>Benefits of Push Protocol Notifications:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Increased User Engagement:</strong>&nbsp;Real-time updates keep users informed and involved, fostering a more active and engaged community around your DeFi or NFT project.
Think of <a href="https://lido.fi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lido</a>, broadcasting regular reward updates to its users who have staked various tokens!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Improved Transparency:</strong>&nbsp;Ensure users are always in the loop with critical announcements and governance proposals delivered directly to their wallets.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For instance, DAOs like <a href="https://www.mantle.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BitDAO</a> can send any new proposal alerts staright to the voting member's wallet address.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enhanced User Experience:</strong>&nbsp;Streamline communication by eliminating the need for users to constantly check social media or email for updates.</li>
</ul>
<p>Defi Protocol's like the <a href="https://app.push.org/channels/0xA2dEe32662F6243dA539bf6A8613F9A9e39843D3?utm_source=Dapp&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=amplify_upgrade" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Angle Protocol</a> leverages Push, to notify its subscriber users with periodic position status updates!</p>
<p><strong>Here's how Push Protocol notifications work in action:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>DeFi platforms like <a href="https://app.push.org/channels/0xAA940b3501176af328423d975C350d0d1BaAae50?utm_source=Dapp&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=amplify_upgrade" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aave</a> send real-time health factor warning alerts to their users, helping them avoid liquidation risks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NFT marketplaces or communities can notify its users about upcoming drops or exclusive minting opportunities.
Similar to the <a href="https://twitter.com/pushprotocol/status/1777929898784444842?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=amplify_upgrade" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pudgy Penguin's Unstopabble Domains token gated group chat</a> powered by Push Protocol.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By leveraging Push Protocol notifications, DeFi and NFT brands can create a more informed and responsive user base, ultimately leading to a stronger and more successful ecosystem.</p>

<p>The revamped Push Protocol group chat takes community management for NFT projects to the next level. It seamlessly integrates token gating, allowing access only to holders of your specific NFT. This fosters an exclusive space for discussions and collaboration.</p>
<p>But it doesn't stop there!
Push Protocol's partnership with <a href="https://guild.xyz/explorer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Guild.xyz</a> allows you to define additional access tiers within the chat using Guild roles. Imagine VIP channels for early adopters or dedicated areas for high-volume traders.</p>
<p>Plus, integration with <a href="https://unstoppabledomains.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unstoppable Domains</a> lets users join using their human-readable addresses (like <strong>yourname.nft</strong>) for a smooth and familiar experience. This revamped group chat empowers you to cultivate a thriving NFT community with targeted communication and a strong sense of belonging.</p>

<p>The Push Network will comprise three different types of Nodes. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Validator nodes</strong> - Batching notifications into blocks, validating them, and providing all the required APIs for SDK.</li>
<li><strong>Storage nodes</strong> - Indexing notifications.</li>
<li><strong>Delivery nodes</strong> - Sending notifications to the end-user device based on his/her 0xwallet, not his/her hardware credentials.</li>
</ul>
<p>The network is guarded by a smart contract to maintain node staking and slashing. This is where the <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/epns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="$PUSH at Coinmarketcap.com"><strong><em><code>$PUSH</code></em></strong></a> token is used.</p>

<p><a href="https://gov.push.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Push DAO</a> is a community-run organization built by Push Protocol enthusiasts. Its goal is to scale Push Protocol's usage and ecosystem. Over time, it will evolve to fully govern Push Protocol's present and future.</p>
<p><strong>How it Works:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The DAO operates through subDAOs (sub-organizations) with specific functions:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li><strong>Business Development (BD) subDAO:</strong>&nbsp;Focuses on growth initiatives for Push Protocol.</li>
<li><strong>Grants subDAO:</strong>&nbsp;Manages community grants and future Push ecosystem grants.</li>
<li><strong>Push Council:</strong>&nbsp;Oversees budgets for all subDAOs and the DAO itself.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Anyone can propose Push Improvement Proposals (PIPs) to improve the protocol.</li>
<li>Initiatives are voted on and implemented seasonally (monthly or quarterly).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Takeaway:</strong></p>
<p>Push DAO is a community-driven force, empowering Push Protocol's growth and future direction.</p>

<p><a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/epns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="$PUSH at Coinmarketcap.com"><strong><em><code>$PUSH</code></em></strong></a> is the native token of the Push Network and it will be used to enable several key functions of the network apart from the already existing utilities defined in the current tokenomics.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Staking for Push Validator Nodes</strong>
Push Validator Nodes are going to be the computational backbone of the Push Network. They will be responsible for validating the network and ensuring that the network is secure and reliable. They are also responsible for penalizing and kicking out bad actors from the network.</li>
</ol>
<p>Running a Push Validator Node will require staking a certain amount of <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/epns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="$PUSH at Coinmarketcap.com"><strong><em><code>$PUSH</code></em></strong></a> tokens along with having a domain name and a server to run the node.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Staking for Push Storage Nodes</strong>
Push Storage Nodes are meant to store the data of the Push Network. They will be responsible for storing the data of the network and ensuring that the data is available to the network.</li>
</ol>
<p>Running a Push Storage Node will also require staking a certain amount of <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/epns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="$PUSH at Coinmarketcap.com"><strong><em><code>$PUSH</code></em></strong></a>.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p><strong>Staking for Push Delivery Nodes</strong>
Push Delivery Nodes serve as a light node that enables the last mile delivery of notifications to the end users. Running them will also have staking requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Stake for Writing API Calls on Push Node</strong>
Having a trustless and decentralized network requires a mechanism to ensure that the network is not spammed with unnecessary API calls. To ensure this, a staking mechanism requiring <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/epns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="$PUSH at Coinmarketcap.com"><strong><em><code>$PUSH</code></em></strong></a> will be introduced for writing API calls on the Push Network for sending notifications.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This is just the beginning of <strong>Push Tokenomics V2</strong> and we are super excited to unveil even more exciting utilities as we progress- Join the Push Fam community on <a href="https://x.com/pushprotocol" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://discord.com/invite/pushprotocol" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord</a> for more updates!</p>]]></content>

<p><a href="https://ens.domains/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ENS (Ethereum Name Service)</a> is a decentralized domain naming system built on top of the Ethereum blockchain.

<p>Push Validator Nodes are going to be the computational backbone of the Push Network. They will be responsible for validating the network and ensuring that the network is secure and reliable. They are also responsible for penalizing and kicking out bad actors from the network.</p>
