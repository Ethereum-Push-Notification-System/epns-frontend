<p>One important aspect of decentralized networks is that they don’t have any central authority that governs their working mechanism. This means, the network must create a system and rules that allows them to not just securely communicate but to also form a consensus on the overall state of the network.</p>
<p>While it's a complicated task and there exists a plethora of imperative ingredients that enable security and fairness in a decentralized network, one of the most significant ones is randomness.</p>
<p>Randomness, in its simplest form, refers to the lack of pattern or predictability in events. It's a concept that plays a crucial role in various fields, from mathematics and computer science to nature itself. Randomness is what makes a dice roll unpredictable, ensures fairness in games, and powers the algorithms behind secure cryptographic systems. In technology, especially within decentralized networks, randomness serves as a fundamental building block that underpins security and fairness, ensuring that processes are free from bias and manipulation.</p>
<p>In this article, we explore the significance of randomness in decentralized networks and how Push nodes incorporate randomness to enhance the security of the Push network.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="why-do-we-even-need-randomness">Why do we even need Randomness?<a href="https://push.org/blog/the-role-of-randomness-in-push-nodes#why-do-we-even-need-randomness" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why do we even need Randomness?" title="Direct link to Why do we even need Randomness?">​</a></h3>
<p>To begin with, let’s understand the importance of Randomness in decentralized networks.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, decentralized networks don’t have a central authority. Instead, they are made of a group of nodes located at different parts of the world. These nodes are responsible to act and perform certain actions in the network to keep it functional.</p>
<p>The selection of nodes to perform specific tasks must happen in a decentralized and fair manner to ensure no single actor in the network is capable of controlling the operations of the network.</p>
<p>This is where randomness plays a critical role.</p>
<p>In such decentralized systems, randomness is used to ensure the unpredictability of various processes, such as selecting validators, generating cryptographic keys, etc.</p>
<p>This unpredictability is essential to prevent malicious actors from gaining control or manipulating the network. For example, in consensus mechanisms like Proof of Stake, a random selection of validators ensures that no single participant can dominate the process, thereby maintaining the decentralized nature of the network involved.</p>
<p>Randomness also enhances the resilience of blockchains by making it difficult for attackers to predict or influence outcomes. This unpredictability protects against various attacks, such as Sybil attacks or collusion, where adversaries attempt to gain disproportionate control over a network.</p>
<p>Moreover, randomness is vital in achieving fairness as it helps ensure that every participant has an equal opportunity to contribute and benefit from a network, regardless of their resources or influence.</p>
<p>Now that we have a basic understanding of how crucial randomness is, let’s understand its how Push Nodes use randomness to enhance their security and fairness.</p>

<p><a href="https://push.org/blog/explaining-push-nodes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Push Nodes</a> are a significant step towards the decentralized infrastructure for web3’s leading communication layer, the Push Protocol Network. This network is designed to facilitate secure and efficient movement of web3 notifications.</p>
<p>The Push Network comprises different types of nodes such as Validator Nodes, Storage nodes, etc. A smart contract guards the network to maintain node staking and slashing. This is where the PUSH token is used.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="how-the-push-network-uses-randomness-to-enhance-its-security">How the Push Network uses Randomness to enhance its Security<a href="https://push.org/blog/the-role-of-randomness-in-push-nodes#how-the-push-network-uses-randomness-to-enhance-its-security" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How the Push Network uses Randomness to enhance its Security" title="Direct link to How the Push Network uses Randomness to enhance its Security">​</a></h3>
<p>In this section, we will specifically understand the complete mechanism of how a transaction is submitted onto Push network and the role of randomness involved in the process.</p>
<p>In the Push Network, the role of randomization is incorporated at multiple levels which allows the network to prevent centralization while ensuring that it remains resilient against a variety of attacks.</p>
<p>A crucial security mechanism of the Push Chain is the randomized selection of validators for transaction validation or block production. This mechanism leverages cryptographic randomness to ensure an unpredictable selection of validators &amp;&nbsp;attestants ( <em>who verify whether or not a transaction is legit</em> ) to enhance the network’s resilience and fairness.</p>
<p>A brief overview of the process looks something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>To send a transaction to the network, the SDK/sender must attach a randomly generated token number to the transaction.</li>
<li>To fetch this token, the SDK can request the same from any validator.</li>
<li>Once received, the SDK attaches this token to the transaction and sends it to the network.</li>
<li>The network then uses this random token to cryptographically decide the specific validator to verify the particular transaction for further processing.</li>
<li>Additionally, the validator also randomly decides the validator set responsible for attesting to the transaction.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="now-lets-dive-deeper-into-the-randomness-of-the-push-network"><strong>Now, let’s dive deeper into the Randomness of the Push Network:</strong><a href="https://push.org/blog/the-role-of-randomness-in-push-nodes#now-lets-dive-deeper-into-the-randomness-of-the-push-network" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to now-lets-dive-deeper-into-the-randomness-of-the-push-network" title="Direct link to now-lets-dive-deeper-into-the-randomness-of-the-push-network">​</a></h3>
<p>The Push SDK selects a random validator (VR1) to generate a special signed (RANDX) hex token.</p>
<p>The generation is performed as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Generation of a Random Token:</strong></p>
<p>The network is designed to ensure that a random token cannot merely be generated by a single validator. Instead, it must be a combined effort as every random token is ideally a collection of digitally signed pieces of random numbers provided by specific validators in the network.</p>
<p>To determine the exact number of such pieces required to form the token, the Validator.sol smart contract defines a parameter called <code>*required_random_number</code>.* This indicates the number of required random peers whose signed values each validator must hold, at a given time. Additionally, the contract also defines an <code>*expiration_time*</code> parameter that defines the expiry time for these tokens which helps ensure that only freshly created tokens can be used for the creation of random tokens.</p>
<p>It should be kept in mind that validators in the network periodically ping their peers to collect and exchange signed random values. The collected value from each validator is a combination of the random value itself and the validator's signature, ensuring it can be verifiable.</p>

<p>As a result, at any given moment the validators should have a collection of signed random values by their peers, i.e., <strong><code>signedRandomValue[].</code></strong></p>
<p>Once a validator has accumulated the necessary signed random values, it can generate the random token. This token is derived from the network's collective randomness using the following formula:</p>

<li>
<p><strong>The SDK Requests for a Random Token</strong></p>
<p>Next, now let’s understand what happens when the SDK requests for a random token.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, before sending any transaction to the network, the SDK&nbsp; requests for a random token that must be attached with the transaction being sent.</p>
<p>Now, since a random token value has already been generated ( as mentioned in step 1), any validator can provide this random token to the SDK.</p>
<p>The SDK then attaches this random token to the transaction payloads and sends the transaction to the network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Randomized Selection of Validators</strong></p>
<p>This random token attached to the transaction plays a crucial role in randomly deciding which validator will process the transaction. With this token, the SDK deciphers the validator ID, to whom it must send the transaction for further processing.</p>

<p>Upon receiving the transaction, the validator checks the random token in the transaction’s payload and validates it to confirm that it has been correctly assigned the role of handling this transaction.</p>
<p>In case the validator identifies that it has been wrongly chosen, <em><strong>it can reject the transaction.</strong></em></p>
<p>Once the accurate assignment of the validator is confirmed, the validator now creates a similar randomized process for creating a list of validators who must attest to the transaction being processed.</p>

<p>To summarize, the entire process detailed above adds a security layer with the inclusion of randomization at multiple levels, i.e.,:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1st Level:</strong> The initial randomization starts with the SDK choosing any random validator to request for a token to be attached to the transaction.</li>
<li><strong>2nd Level: A token is generated</strong> using digitally signed pieces of random values from multiple random validators instead of relying on any single actor.</li>
<li><strong>3rd Level: A specific validator is randomly selected</strong> to create the token to be attached in the transaction occurs.</li>
<li><strong>4th Level:</strong> The final level of randomization determines which specific validator (VR2) will process a transaction and which validator set will act as attestants to verify the transaction.</li>
</ul>
<p>This multi-level randomness ensures that at every step, the network is secure, and fair, while continuing to operate in a completely decentralized fashion.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Cover Image of Push Protocol x Wormhole AMA for the Cross Chain Request Feature in Push V3" src="https://push.org/assets/images/cover-image-87165fed06701e8b218562674f1dacdf.webp" width="1600" height="900" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Last week, we debuted Pre-PIP 3 (Push Improvement Proposal) for <a href="https://push.org/blog/cross-chain-requests-pre-pip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cross Chain Requests</a> on the <a href="https://gov.push.org/t/pre-pip-3-cross-chain-request-feature-in-push-smart-contracts-v3/1794" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Push DAO forum</a> and invited the <a href="https://wormhole.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wormhole</a> team to chat about it, since their tech is a major part of this upgrade.</p>
<p>Here’s a 3-minute recap for those who couldn’t join in:</p>
<p>We kicked off the <a href="https://x.com/pushprotocol/status/1819017203284578483" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spaces</a> with a bit of alpha on Push’s V3 Smart Contracts and what else is coming up from our side as the 2024 rolls on:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Launch of On-Chain Governance</strong>: The V3 contracts will introduce on-chain governance, allowing the community to govern smart contract execution.</li>
<li><strong>Optimized Contracts:</strong> Push’s V3 contracts will be more efficient. They’ll be capable of handling requests from any chain, which will then be relayed to the Ethereum-based Push core contracts for validations and state changes.</li>
<li><strong>Upgraded Incentivized Chats:</strong> Users will be able to initiate and receive paid chats from any chain to any chain, as long as both are supported by the framework.</li>
<li><strong>Cross-Chain Requests (CCR):</strong> This feature allows users to perform actions like creating channels or requests on any blockchain, rather than just on Ethereum. This move is essential for Push to reach a broader audience across different blockchains, including Layer 2 (L2), Layer 3 (L3), and app-specific chains, without increasing friction in the user’s experience with our tech.</li>
<li>A new hub for builders: All of this will enable a new hub for builders to experiment and widen the boundaries of innovation with web3-based consumer apps.</li>
</ol>
<p>We then moved on to Wormhole’s views on the significance of the integration of Push’s smart contracts with their tech:</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="why-push-x-wormhole">Why Push x Wormhole?<a href="https://push.org/blog/ama-with-wormhole-for-cross-chain-requests-pre-pip#why-push-x-wormhole" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why Push x Wormhole?" title="Direct link to Why Push x Wormhole?">​</a></h3>
<p>The integration centers on making the $PUSH token natively fungible across all of the connected chains that Push wants, while enabling native-messaging of all sorts on all involved. We came up with this new multi-chain framework, the Native Token Transfer framework, to enable seamless token transfers across different chains without the need for liquidity pools or complex bridging mechanisms. We both agree that the industry needs to involve into one that is truly interoperable. This is a major step in that direction.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="why-is-pre-pip-3ccr-important">Why is Pre-PIP 3/CCR important?<a href="https://push.org/blog/ama-with-wormhole-for-cross-chain-requests-pre-pip#why-is-pre-pip-3ccr-important" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why is Pre-PIP 3/CCR important?" title="Direct link to Why is Pre-PIP 3/CCR important?">​</a></h3>
<p>The proposal includes detailed research and considerations, focusing on minimal changes to the existing architecture, a security-first approach, and how the technical aspects of Wormhole will enable CCR. This includes the deployment of manager and transceiver contracts on different chains and how these contracts interact with Push’s existing infrastructure.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="why-did-push-choose-wormhole-for-this-integration">Why did Push choose Wormhole for this integration?<a href="https://push.org/blog/ama-with-wormhole-for-cross-chain-requests-pre-pip#why-did-push-choose-wormhole-for-this-integration" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why did Push choose Wormhole for this integration?" title="Direct link to Why did Push choose Wormhole for this integration?">​</a></h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Native Token Transfer (NTT) Framework:</strong> This framework allows for seamless token transfers across different chains without the need for liquidity pools or complex bridging mechanisms.</li>
<li><strong>Security:</strong> Wormhole’s framework is battle-tested and includes additional security measures like rate limiting.</li>
<li><strong>Future-Proofing:</strong> The NTT framework allows Push to maintain governance control over its tokens across multiple chains, which is crucial for its ecosystem and the evolution of its DAO.</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="overview-of-the-wormhole-transceiver-and-security-framework">Overview of the Wormhole Transceiver and Security Framework:<a href="https://push.org/blog/ama-with-wormhole-for-cross-chain-requests-pre-pip#overview-of-the-wormhole-transceiver-and-security-framework" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Overview of the Wormhole Transceiver and Security Framework:" title="Direct link to Overview of the Wormhole Transceiver and Security Framework:">​</a></h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Wormhole Transceiver:</strong> This utilizes the general message passing layer of Wormhole, which relies on a security model with 19 independent "guardians" who verify messages. At least 13 of the 19 guardians must agree to validate a message, making the system highly secure.</li>
<li><strong>Flexibility and Future-Proofing: Wormhole’s</strong> system allows for the adding of other transceivers or message verification protocols, such as off-chain processes or ZK transceivers for enhanced security.</li>
<li><strong>Overall Security and Reliability:</strong> Wormhole has processed over a billion messages while maintaining consistently high security and resilience across its network. The platform already provably supports the future of secure message and token transfers across chains.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li><strong>Security-First Approach:</strong> Push Protocol has always and continues to prioritize security, ensuring that the deployment of tokens and messages on multiple chains is always protected and that protection always increases.</li>
<li><strong>Cross-Chain Request (CCR):</strong> With CCR live, users will be able to execute actions (e.g., creating channels) across different chains without leaving their native chain or bridging tokens. The integration with Wormhole makes this process more seamless and efficient.</li>
<li><strong>User Experience:</strong> Post-CCR’s launch, actions like channel creation will become more straightforward, with users able to operate across chains without the hassle of managing tokens or gas fees on multiple networks to get to their intended destination.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li><strong>Unified API and Multi-Chain Notifications:</strong> Developers can build once and notify everywhere, simplifying cross-chain interactions and enhancing user engagement. This reduces development complexity and improves resource management.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced Functionality and Interoperability:</strong> The integration allows for smart contracts on one chain to trigger notifications on another, improving the overall functionality of decentralized applications (dApps).</li>
<li><strong>Security Enhancements:</strong> Wormhole’s security features, like rate-limiting, access control, and defense mechanisms, ensure that cross-chain communications remain verifiably secure.</li>
</ol>
<p>The integration of Push Protocol's Cross-Chain Requests (CCR) with Wormhole represents a pivotal advancement in decentralized technology. This advancement strengthens Push’s security, raises its scalability, and broadens its reach across multiple blockchains, paving the way for a more connected and user-friendly Web3 experience for all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introducing Pre-PIP 3 (Push Improvement Proposal) for Cross-Chain Requests:]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Cover Image of Introducing Pre-PIP 3 (Push Improvement Proposal) for Cross-Chain Requests" src="https://push.org/assets/images/cover-image-57bca9ea6556a16c996e32f0d3721977.webp" width="1600" height="900" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Push Protocol, the leading web3 communication layer, has proposed a major upgrade with the introduction of <a href="https://gov.push.org/t/pre-pip-3-cross-chain-request-feature-in-push-smart-contracts-v3/1794" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pre-PIP (Push Improvement Proposal) for Cross-Chain Requests (CCR)</a>. This proposal aims to enable users to interact with Push Protocol smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain from any blockchain network, whether it’s EVM-based or non-EVM. Once CCR is implemented, users will be able to stay on their preferred blockchain while accessing Push Protocol's services, offering enhanced convenience and flexibility.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="what-is-ccr-cross-chain-requests-and-its-impact">What is CCR (Cross-Chain Requests) and its impact?<a href="https://push.org/blog/cross-chain-requests-pre-pip#what-is-ccr-cross-chain-requests-and-its-impact" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is CCR (Cross-Chain Requests) and its impact?" title="Direct link to What is CCR (Cross-Chain Requests) and its impact?">​</a></h3>
<p>In the current Push Protocol architecture, performing any important task related to channels like creating a channel, modification of a channel, changing a channel’s state, etc, requires the user/protocol to interact with the Push Smart Contract which is only deployed on Ethereum Blockchain.</p>
<p>This led to a bad user experience for the user/protocol as they need to switch to the Ethereum network for any interaction they might want to do with the Push Core contract. This is currently a friction point for users who primarily operate on other EVM-compatible chains and even non-EVM users.</p>
<p>Cross-chain requests will eliminate the need to switch to the Ethereum Network making it possible to create a channel, use Push services, or interact with Push Protocol’s Ethereum smart contract from any blockchain they like, whether it’s another EVM chain or non-EVM chain.</p>
<p>Additionally, this was not just something that users faced but more for Push Protocol as it limits Push Protocol's ability to tap into other chains and help solve the communication/notification issues of those chains adequately. This constraint hinders the protocol from reaching a broader audience and solving communication issues across diverse blockchain environments.</p>
<p>Therefore, by enabling the Cross-Chain Request feature, Push Protocol can primarily significantly enhance the UX for average users as well as channel creators/managers from not just Ethereum but multiple other EVM/Non-EVM chains as well. It also allows the protocol to expand its market reach, attract users from different chains, and foster a more interconnected blockchain ecosystem.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="importance-of-ccr-cross-chain-requests">Importance of CCR (Cross-Chain Requests):<a href="https://push.org/blog/cross-chain-requests-pre-pip#importance-of-ccr-cross-chain-requests" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Importance of CCR (Cross-Chain Requests):" title="Direct link to Importance of CCR (Cross-Chain Requests):">​</a></h3>
<p>The Cross Chain Requests (CCR) feature is crucial for the future success and growth of the Push Protocol:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Enhanced User Experience:</strong> The CCR feature will significantly enhance user experience by eliminating the need for users to switch networks or manually bridge tokens to interact with the Push Core contract on Ethereum. This streamlined process will allow users to perform key actions like channel creation and incentivize chat requests directly from their preferred blockchain, reducing both complexity and transaction costs. By making these features accessible from various chains, CCR removes barriers for new and existing users, fostering a more inclusive and user-friendly environment.</li>
<li><strong>Broader Reach:</strong> The CCR feature will expand the reach of Push Protocol across the blockchain ecosystem. By enabling interactions from multiple EVM and non-EVM chains, CCR will not only broaden the protocol's user base but also tap into diverse blockchain communities that might benefit from Push’s communication and notification features. This increased accessibility helps Push Protocol grow its market presence and integrate with a wider range of blockchain projects, ultimately supporting the development of a more interconnected and collaborative blockchain network.</li>
<li><strong>Revolutionizing Web3 Communications</strong>: CCR future-proofs Push Protocol against the rapid evolution of the blockchain space. As new chains and technologies emerge, CCR’s cross-chain capabilities ensure that Push Protocol remains adaptable and relevant. By leveraging established technologies like Wormhole’s NTT framework and Relayers, CCR positions Push Protocol to embrace future advancements and continue delivering value to its users across an ever-expanding blockchain landscape.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Here’s a simple overview of how CCR works:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Initiate Request</strong>: A user on another blockchain (like Polygon) wants to perform an action, such as creating a new channel for sending notifications.</li>
<li><strong>Submit Details</strong>: The user uses a special function on the Push Communicator contract on their preferred blockchain to submit the request, providing the necessary details and approving the $PUSH tokens for the action.</li>
<li><strong>Send Data and Tokens</strong>: The Push Communicator contract validates the input, creates a message payload, and uses Wormhole Relayers to securely send this payload and the $PUSH tokens to the Push Core contract on Ethereum.</li>
<li><strong>Process Request</strong>: On Ethereum, the Push Core contract receives the message and tokens, decodes the request, validates it, and performs the required action.</li>
<li><strong>Completion</strong>: The request is completed on Ethereum, and any unused native tokens are refunded to the user on their original blockchain.</li>

<p>Imagine Bob, a Polygon user, wants to create a channel for sending notifications.</p>
<p>Previously, he'd need to switch to Ethereum, bridge tokens, and change networks. With CCR, Bob simply uses the familiar Push Communicator contract on Polygon.</p>
<p>The contract acts as a bridge, relaying Bob's request (channel details) and the required PUSH tokens (bridged via Wormhole) to the Push Core contract on Ethereum.</p>
<p>All behind the scenes, without Bob ever leaving Polygon! This creates a seamless experience for users on any chain, opening Push Protocol to a wider audience.</p>

<p>While putting Push Core on every blockchain might seem easy, it's quite tricky.</p>
<p>It would be hard to manage separate fees and keep all the information on different chains in sync, which could even be risky.</p>
<p>That's why we're improving the existing Push Communicator contracts to handle these requests. We'll also use a reliable system called Wormhole to securely send information and tokens between blockchains. This way, everything works smoothly without needing Push Core on every chain.

<p>To implement Cross-Chain Requests (CCR), we will:</p>
<ol>
<li>Enable $Push Token for multi-chain support.</li>
<li>Build cross-chain support in the Push Communicator and Push Core Contract.</li>
<li>Use Wormhole’s Relayer Interface and NTT framework for token transfers across chains.</li>
<li>Equip the Push Communicator to handle cross-chain actions like channel creation and requests.</li>
<li>Modify the Push Core Contract to process cross-chain payloads.</li>
<li>Conduct security audits and deploy the updated contracts on the testnet and mainnet.</li>
</ol>

<p>CCR feature is a significant step forward for Push Protocol. It paves the way for a more interconnected and user-friendly communication layer within the ever-expanding blockchain landscape.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for further updates as we implement CCR and empower users to unlock the full potential of Web3 communication!</p>]]></content>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Moving across an open web with Push]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Cover image of Case Study - Moving across an open web with Push" src="https://push.org/assets/images/cover-image-c9dfc8a9752992a8c97ecf5c76e0095e.webp" width="1600" height="900" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>With every passing day, the blockchain industry continues to become more mature and inch closer towards achieving the operational level comfort that today’s web2 world offers.</p>
<p>In this pursuit, we’re witnessing a period of massive experimentation in on-chain infrastructure design.</p>
<p>A natural trend observed in the EVM space is vertical growth through Rollups, Layer 2, and Layer 3 networks. The common goal of this design shift is to achieve scalability and, as a result, a higher degree of interoperability.</p>
<p>But as the web3 dev community continues to take bigger strides in achieving transactional interoperability, app-to-user, app-to-app, and user-to-user communication are still at nascent steps.</p>
<p>Push is working towards diminishing this divide between transactional and communication interoperability by building a robust, secure fabric that weaves multiple chains and services together by forming the <strong>“Universal Layer2 Of Communication”</strong>.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="fragmented-ecosystem">Fragmented Ecosystem<a href="https://push.org/blog/interoperable-communications-moving-across-an-open-web-with-push#fragmented-ecosystem" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Fragmented Ecosystem" title="Direct link to Fragmented Ecosystem">​</a></h2>
<p>Web3 operates on a multitude of blockchains, each with its own protocols, standards, and its own unique set of rules. This creates independent and isolated silos of information, making it difficult for users, services and applications built on separate chains to interact and communicate with each other unanimously.</p>
<p>Push continues to form a communication blanket over the fragmented ecosystem and provide its communication services to multiple EVM and non-EVM based chains. At present, Push supports over 7 networks including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ethereum</li>
<li>Polyogn</li>
<li>Polygon zkEVM</li>
<li>Arbitrum</li>
<li>Binance Smart Chain (BNB)</li>
<li>Fuse</li>
<li>Cyber</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Communicator contracts (Push Comm V2) serve as a middleware for listening to inbound communications</strong>&nbsp;and events from the Client Application’s smart contract. Thus, shouldering the responsibility of on-chain communication across contracts deployed on multiple chains (EVM and non-EVM).</p>
<p>Notifications can not always be triggered as a result of an on-chain event. Many notifications, especially the ones that are more inclined towards driving engagement can be considered off-chain. Push ensures that any frontend, service, backend or smart contract can easily send communication payloads across the diverse participants and devices ( App, Wallet, Extension, Frontends and more).</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="data-availability-no-communication-da-layer">Data Availability (no communication DA layer)<a href="https://push.org/blog/interoperable-communications-moving-across-an-open-web-with-push#data-availability-no-communication-da-layer" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Data Availability (no communication DA layer)" title="Direct link to Data Availability (no communication DA layer)">​</a></h2>
<p>Traditionally, Data Availability (DA) ensures that the data needed to validate a block is accessible to the majority of network participants. However, in the context of interoperable communications within Web3, we need a broader concept: “<strong>Communication DA”</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>What's the problem?</strong>
From an end user's perspective, app notifications and other forms of read-write communications (messaging, groupchats, videocalls) should be accessible regardless of the platform, service, hardware and underlying chain they use.  Previously, there was no standardized middleware mechanism to link communication across platforms and chains.</p>
<p>Push solves this problem. Being an open network, Push enables any frontend, service, or backend to securely tap into the Push network and extract the necessary communication payloads in a platform-agnostic manner.</p>
<p>Simply put, <strong>your communication travels with your web3 identity: your wallet.</strong></p>

<p>In a typical web3 user journey, A user’s wallet , is the first element that unlocks transactional interoperability by  allowing users to seamlessly transfer assets and interact with dApps regardless of their underlying set of rules.</p>
<p>Push Protocol extends the scope of this interoperability by  enabling cross-chain communication in form of notifications and messaging for Dapps, wallets, and services by tying it to the wallet addresses in an open, cryptographically encrypted and gasless manner.</p>
<p>Notifications from various protocols and services are accessible regardless of the chains they originate from. All subscribed channel notifications are synchronized and displayed in one place within your Push-compatible wallet.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://dappradar.com/blog/state-of-the-dapp-industry-q1-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DApp Radar</a>, Q1 2024 saw a remarkable surge in daily active wallet users (dUAW), reaching an average of 7 million daily active wallets—a 77% increase compared to the previous year.</p>
<p>The numbers clearly show that the entry into web3 starts from a wallet. With more than 120 wallet apps in market, Push presents an opportunity to revolutionise their UX by reaching to these wallet addresses. And essentially pave the way to <strong>onboard the first Billion users into web3</strong>.</p>
<p>Protocols, services, and DApps can tap into a highly scalable  distribution stream with the help of Push. Push ties all application-specific communication to the user's wallet address, ensuring zero user friction and exponentially growing the client protocol's distribution.</p>

<p>Notifications delivered directly to users' wallets enhance a DApp's brand recall by keeping it at the forefront of users' minds. Users can interact with these notifications, enabling them to visit the DApp and view updates promptly.</p>
<p>When more applications can reach out to their user’s wallet, across multiple networks it opens new avenues for engagement, customer retention and brand building.</p>

<p>With respect to communications, decentralization can be broken down into:</p>
<ol>
<li>Immutability of communication payloads/messages</li>
<li>Inability to censor content.</li>
</ol>
<p>Push maintains immutability and censorship resistance  by encrypting mission critical communication payloads and messaging chats ensuring highest standards of communication security.</p>

<p>Across multiple genres including, Gaming, DeFI, Governance and Wallets, Push enables multiple ways for the DApps to tap into the the protocol’s Communication DA Layer (i.e Push Network) and extract notifications in a platform agnostic manner.</p>
<p>For instance, <a href="https://decentraland.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Decentraland</a> users can choose to opt into and receive notifications into the platform frontend as well as receive the notifications directly into their Metamask Snap wallet.</p>

<p>We believe communications is a public good and a bare necessity for a frictionless digital life.
This also means that the means to provide communications and access them should not be limited to one or atmost two mediums.</p>
<p>Push invented the communication network for web3 with a similar vision of enabling communication experiences unconstrained by chains.</p>
<p><strong>A user of chain 'X' should not only be able to communicate with other users and services on that chain but also with users and services on chain 'Y' seamlessly, without added friction.</strong></p>
<p>This is how Push is pushing towards forming a universal communication network of web3 encompassing all networks ensuring you, as a user can move across the open web along with your communications with ease.</p>]]></content>

<p>Creating your on-chain community on Push Protocol is fairly easy.</p>
<p>This guide will walk you through the step by step process of creating your own vibrant community on Push Protocol, right from setting up a strong foundation to complete community formation.</p>
<p>To illustrate the journey, lets imagine a community dedicated to a captivating NFT collection known as '<strong>Charcoal Cats🐱</strong>'. In this guide we will show you, how to create a conditionally gated group chat exclusively for these Charcoal Cats admirers.</p>
<p>Building a strong online community takes more than just setting up a group chat.
Before diving in to the group creation process, let's explore some key considerations to form a solid foundation of your community.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="1define-your-communitys-purpose">1.Define your community's purpose<a href="https://push.org/blog/how-to-create-your-community-on-push-chat#1define-your-communitys-purpose" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1.Define your community's purpose" title="Direct link to 1.Define your community's purpose">​</a></h3>
<p>Members join and leave the communities, but what remains constant is the community's  purpose.
Find out what common interests will unite your members?<br>
<!-- -->For Example : The 'Charcoal Cats🐱' community is cult camp of charcoal cat NFT lovers. The access to the chat is restricted to only those wallets who hold 'Charcoal Cats' NFT/s.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="2choose-your-community-type">2.Choose your community type<a href="https://push.org/blog/how-to-create-your-community-on-push-chat#2choose-your-community-type" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2.Choose your community type" title="Direct link to 2.Choose your community type">​</a></h3>
<p>Do you prefer a community which is more welcoming, open &amp; visible to all (i.e Public Group Chats) or rather prefer to form a exclusive community which is only visible to the individuals who are invited, are a part of the community or satisfy the criteria to join it.</p>
<p>Push enables both, Public and Private communities with the ability to establish gating conditions for <strong>controlled access</strong>.</p>
<p>With respect to our  example, lets  keep the Charcoal Cats a private community where-in the messages are encrypted and only visible upon successfully joining the group.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="3decide-open-to-all-or-conditionally-gated-group-chat">3.Decide: Open to all OR Conditionally Gated Group Chat<a href="https://push.org/blog/how-to-create-your-community-on-push-chat#3decide-open-to-all-or-conditionally-gated-group-chat" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 3.Decide: Open to all OR Conditionally Gated Group Chat" title="Direct link to 3.Decide: Open to all OR Conditionally Gated Group Chat">​</a></h3>
<p>Groupchats that do not impose any pre-requsite condition before joining the group can be termed as <strong>open groupchats</strong>.
For instance, media oriented groupchats can be joined by anyone directly.</p>
<p><strong>Conditionally Gated Chats</strong></p>
<p>Group chats that impose one or multiple conditions for users and allows only those users who satisfy these conditions are termed as <strong>conditionally gated chats</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Conditions are a series of criterias that can be applied for both, joining the group as well as for chatting in the group.</strong></p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="tailoring-access-with-any-or-all-settings">Tailoring Access with "Any" or "All" Settings<a href="https://push.org/blog/how-to-create-your-community-on-push-chat#tailoring-access-with-any-or-all-settings" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Tailoring Access with &quot;Any&quot; or &quot;All&quot; Settings" title="Direct link to Tailoring Access with &quot;Any&quot; or &quot;All&quot; Settings">​</a></h3>
<p>Push Protocol gives you further control by letting you define how users meet the set criteria. You can choose between:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>'Any' setting:</strong> Here, users only need to meet one of the defined criteria to gain access. This allows for a more inclusive approach.</li>
<li><strong>'All' setting:</strong> This requires users to satisfy all the defined criteria, creating a more exclusive space.</li>
</ul>
<p>Push Chat provides the following settings to configure your gated chat group:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Types of communities" src="https://push.org/assets/images/image1-a5b03ff26a0d5e8b18d8003c9f35e2dc.webp" width="2000" height="1125" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Criteria</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>ERC20 -Tokens</td><td>User needs to hold XX token to join the group</td></tr><tr><td>ERC721 - NFTs</td><td>User needs to hold XX NFT to join the group.</td></tr><tr><td>Invite</td><td>Both Owners and Admins can invite people to join the group. You can further customize invite privileges by specifying whether both Owner and Admin need to approve invites, or if either of them can do so independently.</td></tr><tr><td>Guild</td><td>Ability to set non-web3 native conditions using <a href="https://guild.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Guild.xyz</a></td></tr><tr><td>Custom Endpoint</td><td>URL provided for custom usecases.</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>So, are you ready to build your dream community?  Let's get started!  We'll walk you through the creation process using our example of : the 'Charcoal Cats🐱' NFT Gated community groupchat.</p>

<p>In the ever-evolving landscape of Web3, as protocols become more innovative and mature, the need for web3 wallets to act as a bridge for onboarding typical Internet (web2) users into web3 with minimal friction is advancing rapidly.</p>
<p>Amidst these technical advancements, communication remains a paramount factor in driving this transformation.</p>
<p>Today, Push Protocol is at the forefront, enabling wallets to enhance their functionality and better serve their users by becoming a <strong>'Super App’</strong>.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="challenges">Challenges<a href="https://push.org/blog/how-wallets-use-push-to-become-a-super-app#challenges" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Challenges" title="Direct link to Challenges">​</a></h2>
<p>According to <a href="https://dappradar.com/blog/state-of-the-dapp-industry-q1-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DApp Radar</a>, Q1 2024 saw a remarkable surge in daily active wallet users (dUAW), reaching an average of <strong>7 million</strong> daily active wallets—a <strong>77%</strong> increase compared to the previous year.</p>
<p>The numbers clearly show that the entry into web3 starts from a wallet. With more than 120 wallet apps, the sheer innovation in onboarding the next Billion users into web3 is surreal.</p>
<p>Although wallets are expanding their utility from simply being a medium of secure storage and a facilitator of transactions to now, becoming a <em>‘Super Hub’</em> for NFT, DeFi, and app browsing activities, they still lack the ability to consistently relay updates and alerts between the user and the accessed protocol while maintaining a constant, symbiotic and duplex communication relationship.</p>
<p>In addition, multi-chain wallets serve as a single entry point for users to interact with applications across a variety of supported chains with ease. However, there is no standardized way for these apps to communicate back with users through the same entrance point i.e. your wallet.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="solution">Solution<a href="https://push.org/blog/how-wallets-use-push-to-become-a-super-app#solution" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Solution" title="Direct link to Solution">​</a></h2>
<p><strong>Push helps us solve these challenges.</strong></p>
<p>With the help of an open - decentralized and secure network supported across multiple chains, Push facilitates any wallet, DApp, service or smart contract to tap into the network and fetch notifications with ease.</p>
<p>With the motive of forming a universal communication layer of web3, Push Protocol is expanding its support to multiple chains including <strong>Ethereum, Polygon, BSC, Arbitrum, Polygon zkEVM, Cyber and Fuse</strong>.</p>
<p>To date, Push has sent over <strong>80 Million Notifications</strong> across <strong>230k+ subscribers</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>How does Unstopppable Lite Wallet ensure smooth UX and Communication?</strong></p>
<p>Many of the Unstopppable Lite Wallet users are new to web3, so an intuitive and easy to use experience are essential. Inline education and clear messages help new users understand what can be a difficult learning curve.</p>
<p><strong>How does Push fit into the overall strategic goals of Unstoppable Lite Wallet?</strong></p>
<p>Messaging is built directly into Unstoppable Lite Wallet. Push Protocol enables token gated group chat. Messaging is built directly into Unstoppable Lite Wallet.</p>
<p>As Push Protocol enables wallet to wallet token gated group chatting, depending on domains and badges, users have access to various conditionally gated group chats where they can engage with others.</p>
<p><strong>Overcoming seed phrase scares using MPC</strong></p>
<p>The unstoppable lite wallet features advanced multi-party computation (MPC) technology provided by Fireblocks to improve safety for the self-custody wallet. Users are able to manage their wallet using an email address and password, instead of worrying about seed phrases.
