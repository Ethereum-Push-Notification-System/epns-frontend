<p>We're back with Frens of Push, offering a deep dive into the top protocols and Push ecosystem partners. This week, our fren is QuickSwap, the leading DEX &amp; AMM on Polygon.</p>
<p>QuickSwap is the leading DEX on Polygon PoS, Polygon zkEVM, and Dogechain that’s fully decentralized and community-driven, building a comprehensive suite of DeFi products called the DragonFi ecosystem. It’s renowned for its high-performance, cost-efficient DeFi platforms, and pioneering role in onboarding new users and capital to the broader Polygon ecosystem.</p>
<p>By way of this collaboration, Push provides QuickSwap with the infrastructure to facilitate its users by alerting users to swap events and changing token prices, as well as for V3 liquidity alerts. QuickSwap relies on Push’s communication layer to deliver in-app notifications while ensuring a decentralized relay and storage.</p>
<p>In this episode of “Frens of Push”, Roc, Founder <a href="https://twitter.com/QuickSwapDEX" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@QuickSwapDEX</a>, joins us to talk about how the collaboration between Push and QuickSwap has the potential to disrupt web3 communication.</p>

<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="hi-roc-whats-your-story-how-did-you-become-involved-in-building-in-the-blockchain-space-what-are-you-working-on-now">Hi Roc, what’s your story? How did you become involved in building in the blockchain space? What are you working on now?<a href="https://push.org/blog/quickswap-joins-frens-of-push#hi-roc-whats-your-story-how-did-you-become-involved-in-building-in-the-blockchain-space-what-are-you-working-on-now" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Hi Roc, what’s your story?

How did you become involved in building in the blockchain space? What are you working on now?">​</a></h3>
<p><b>Roc:</b> I’ve been around the Web3 space for a long time – since the early days of both Bitcoin and Ethereum. As a libertarian, Bitcoin was my first love so to speak. As an elegant solution to an age-old monetary dilemma that has plagued humanity, I was on board and extremely interested right away.</p>
<p>However, as the Web3 industry has grown and evolved around Bitcoin, my interests have evolved as well in the years since I discovered Bitcoin. Today, I see the power of decentralized systems as being capable of resolving far more problems than just sound money. The power of decentralized finance to free up dormant capital, vastly improve capital efficiency, and provide individuals across the world with a more level playing field and opportunities to invest and capitalize on their skills excites me very much.</p>
<p>Today, I am leading Lunar Digital Assets (LDA), a premier marketing agency and incubator that helps rising Web3 projects to get the most out of their technology. We specialize in brand building, narrative formation, and effective marketing strategies. QuickSwap is one of our long-time clients, and we go way back with the team at Polygon Labs, too. At LDA, We see a great deal of promise in the ecosystem being developed in Polygon 2.0, and we are positioning QuickSwap to be a key player in all things Polygon DeFi. Keep an eye on us!</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="tell-us-about-quickswap--whats-it-about-and-what-problem-does-quickswap-solve">Tell us about QuickSwap — what’s it about and what problem does QuickSwap solve?<a href="https://push.org/blog/quickswap-joins-frens-of-push#tell-us-about-quickswap--whats-it-about-and-what-problem-does-quickswap-solve" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Tell us about QuickSwap — what’s it about and what problem does QuickSwap solve?" title="Direct link to Tell us about QuickSwap — what’s it about and what problem does QuickSwap solve?">​</a></h3>
<p><b>Roc:</b> QuickSwap is the premier DeFi suite on Polygon, bar none. Since the infamous 2020 DeFi wave, QuickSwap has been committed to providing Web3 users of all demographics with the simplest, most intuitive user experience possible. On this accord, QuickSwap has served as an evangelizing force for Polygon’s scalability stack, in the mission to drive down costs and transaction times. More recently, QuickSwap has acted as a first mover deploying on Polygon’s latest high-performance chain, zkEVM as well.</p>
<p>With QuickSwap, whether you’re looking to swap, stake, and farm on a lightning-fast DEX or trade high-stakes perpetual contracts, you know you’re going to get the best of everything. The latest features, the slickest user experience, the lowest fees, and of course, true decentralization. Between the QuickSwap DAO’s governance votes and discussions, and Polygon’s decentralized architecture, users no longer have to choose between high-performance decentralized systems and user-friendly UIs – with QuickSwap, it’s the best of everything, all in one place.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="how-do-developers-use-quickswap">How do developers use QuickSwap?<a href="https://push.org/blog/quickswap-joins-frens-of-push#how-do-developers-use-quickswap" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How do developers use QuickSwap?" title="Direct link to How do developers use QuickSwap?">​</a></h3>
<p><b>Roc:</b> Developers are free and welcome to explore QuickSwap’s documentation and to connect with the team to send in suggestions, new ideas, and business development proposals. QuickSwap has been integrating new technologies on a monthly basis for years now – not to mention integrating QuickSwap’s platforms on new and rising Polygon CDK chains. For the technical folks out there, go right ahead and check out <a href="https://github.com/QuickSwap/quickswap-docs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">QuickSwap’s GitHub</a>.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="whats-the-2024-plan-for-quickswap-and-its-ecosystem">What’s the 2024 plan for QuickSwap and its ecosystem?<a href="https://push.org/blog/quickswap-joins-frens-of-push#whats-the-2024-plan-for-quickswap-and-its-ecosystem" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What’s the 2024 plan for QuickSwap and its ecosystem?" title="Direct link to What’s the 2024 plan for QuickSwap and its ecosystem?">​</a></h3>
<p><b>Roc:</b> I’m glad you asked! QuickSwap released its plans for DragonFi 2.0 in December 2023, and I have to say: that the project has been delivering right on schedule. QuickSwap’s DragonFi 2.0 initiative focuses on deploying the QuickSwap DeFi suite – a QuickSwap Citadel, as it’s called – to as many newly arriving Polygon CDK (Chain Development Kit) chains as possible. The mission is simple: to become the dominant DeFi force on Polygon 2.0, and eventually, to conquer the entire Web3 DeFi scene as the go-to homebase for ultra-high-performance, ultra-low-cost, ultra-liquid….well, you get it.</p>
<p>This year, QuickSwap has stayed true to its word, deploying Citadels on a number of new Polygon chains, including zkAstar, Immutable zkEVM, and Manta Pacific. The movement is underway, and QuickSwap’s user base and key metrics are growing every week.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="how-is-quickswap-using-pushs-web3-communication-layer">How is QuickSwap using Push’s web3 communication layer?<a href="https://push.org/blog/quickswap-joins-frens-of-push#how-is-quickswap-using-pushs-web3-communication-layer" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How is QuickSwap using Push’s web3 communication layer?" title="Direct link to How is QuickSwap using Push’s web3 communication layer?">​</a></h3>
<p><b>Roc:</b> At present, QuickSwap is using the Push communication layer to alert users as to swap events, and changing token prices, as well as for V3 liquidity alerts – for instance, when a user’s liquidity falls out of range.</p>
<p>But there’s a lot more in the works and on the way. Already, QuickSwap has plans to leverage the Push communication layer to keep users informed with a range of new notifications, including those related to perpetual contracts, limit order and TWAP limit order execution, new farm and bond deployment, and the conclusion and closure of various farming opportunities. There’s a lot to look forward to in the world of QuickSwap – thanks to the whole team over at Push.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="how-would-you-describe-your-experience-using-push-what-benefits-have-you-seen">How would you describe your experience using Push? What benefits have you seen?<a href="https://push.org/blog/quickswap-joins-frens-of-push#how-would-you-describe-your-experience-using-push-what-benefits-have-you-seen" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How would you describe your experience using Push? What benefits have you seen?" title="Direct link to How would you describe your experience using Push? What benefits have you seen?">​</a></h3>
<p><b>Roc:</b> Above all, Push is super user-friendly and intuitive. As a project fully committed to delivering a best-in-class user experience, QuickSwap is of the opinion that using Web3 ecosystems should be as simple as possible. Otherwise, onboarding ain’t happening. On that thread, setting up notifications should be just as easy as receiving them. Thankfully, Push has absolutely nailed it in the communications department and is setting up a much-needed set of communications tooling and services.</p>
<p>For QuickSwap, that means improving user experience for traders is easier than ever before – you might call it the best user experience experience on the market!</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="what-cool-use-cases-do-you-see-push-being-used-for-in-the-future">What cool use cases do you see Push being used for in the future?<a href="https://push.org/blog/quickswap-joins-frens-of-push#what-cool-use-cases-do-you-see-push-being-used-for-in-the-future" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What cool use cases do you see Push being used for in the future?" title="Direct link to What cool use cases do you see Push being used for in the future?">​</a></h3>
<p><b>Roc:</b> As the world continues to migrate to the on-chain domain, notifications will become absolutely necessary built-in features – especially for Layer 1 transactions that necessarily involve some degree of latency. Transaction confirmations aren’t the only examples – as SocialFi expands, on-chain identity tooling picks up traction, and payment rails integrate digital assets, notifications will become essential for users to utilize decentralized systems and their native assets with confidence. Push is standing at the very frontier of digital innovation – right alongside QuickSwap, that is!</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="what-is-your-take-on-the-future-of-defi-on-polygon-and-how-quickswap-plans-to-leverage-it">What is your take on the future of DeFi on Polygon and how QuickSwap plans to leverage it?<a href="https://push.org/blog/quickswap-joins-frens-of-push#what-is-your-take-on-the-future-of-defi-on-polygon-and-how-quickswap-plans-to-leverage-it" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is your take on the future of DeFi on Polygon and how QuickSwap plans to leverage it?" title="Direct link to What is your take on the future of DeFi on Polygon and how QuickSwap plans to leverage it?">​</a></h3>
<p><b>Roc:</b> In the QuickSwap community, everyone is very, very excited about the interoperable Polygon 2.0 ecosystem that is beginning to take form. Simply put, the ease of deployment provided by Polygon CDK and the immense benefits that chains and their users are reaping from unified liquidity and seamless interoperability is going to revolutionize what is possible in Web3.</p>
<p>In the Layer 2 race, QuickSwap is proud to be utilizing the next generation of rising Polygon technologies, yet again. The project invites new users, developer teams, and other enthusiasts from around the space to check out Web3’s most epic scalability stack yet for themselves!</p>

<p>Thanks, Roc for the awesome conversation. Looking forward to revolutionizing web3 communication together with QuickSwap!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Revolutionising Communication for DeFi and NFT Brands with Push!]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Cover Image of Revolutionising Communication for DeFi and NFT Brands with Push " src="https://push.org/assets/images/cover-image-aa62458a193c0aebdadb58509a209af4.webp" width="1600" height="900" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>The decentralized revolution is upon us, with DeFi (Decentralized Finance) and NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) leading the charge. However, fostering strong communication and community engagement in these fast-paced ecosystems can be a challenge.</p>
<p><a href="https://push.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Push Protocol</a> emerges as a game-changer, offering a secure and scalable solution for DeFi and NFT brands to connect with their user base effectively. Let's delve into how Push Protocol empowers these brands in two key areas: sending notifications and managing communities.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="seamless-notification-delivery">Seamless Notification Delivery:<a href="https://push.org/blog/revolutionising-communication-for-defi-and-nft-with-push#seamless-notification-delivery" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Seamless Notification Delivery:" title="Direct link to Seamless Notification Delivery:">​</a></h3>
<p>Gone are the days of unreliable social media notifications and clunky email lists. Push Protocol enables DeFi and NFT brands to deliver real-time, secure notifications directly to users' crypto wallets. This ensures critical updates, price fluctuations, governance proposals, and exclusive announcements reach your audience instantly.</p>
<p><strong>Benefits of Push Protocol Notifications:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Increased User Engagement:</strong>&nbsp;Real-time updates keep users informed and involved, fostering a more active and engaged community around your DeFi or NFT project.
Think of <a href="https://lido.fi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lido</a>, broadcasting regular reward updates to its users who have staked various tokens!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Improved Transparency:</strong>&nbsp;Ensure users are always in the loop with critical announcements and governance proposals delivered directly to their wallets.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For instance, DAOs like <a href="https://www.mantle.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BitDAO</a> can send any new proposal alerts staright to the voting member's wallet address.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enhanced User Experience:</strong>&nbsp;Streamline communication by eliminating the need for users to constantly check social media or email for updates.</li>
</ul>
<p>Defi Protocol's like the <a href="https://app.push.org/channels/0xA2dEe32662F6243dA539bf6A8613F9A9e39843D3?utm_source=Dapp&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=amplify_upgrade" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Angle Protocol</a> leverages Push, to notify its subscriber users with periodic position status updates!</p>
<p><strong>Here's how Push Protocol notifications work in action:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>DeFi platforms like <a href="https://app.push.org/channels/0xAA940b3501176af328423d975C350d0d1BaAae50?utm_source=Dapp&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=amplify_upgrade" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aave</a> send real-time health factor warning alerts to their users, helping them avoid liquidation risks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NFT marketplaces or communities can notify its users about upcoming drops or exclusive minting opportunities.

<p>The Push Network will comprise three different types of Nodes. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Validator nodes</strong> - Batching notifications into blocks, validating them, and providing all the required APIs for SDK.</li>
<li><strong>Storage nodes</strong> - Indexing notifications.</li>
<li><strong>Delivery nodes</strong> - Sending notifications to the end-user device based on his/her 0xwallet, not his/her hardware credentials.</li>
</ul>
<p>The network is guarded by a smart contract to maintain node staking and slashing. This is where the <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/epns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="$PUSH at Coinmarketcap.com"><strong><em><code>$PUSH</code></em></strong></a> token is used.</p>

<p><a href="https://gov.push.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Push DAO</a> is a community-run organization built by Push Protocol enthusiasts. Its goal is to scale Push Protocol's usage and ecosystem. Over time, it will evolve to fully govern Push Protocol's present and future.</p>
<p><strong>How it Works:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The DAO operates through subDAOs (sub-organizations) with specific functions:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li><strong>Business Development (BD) subDAO:</strong>&nbsp;Focuses on growth initiatives for Push Protocol.</li>
<li><strong>Grants subDAO:</strong>&nbsp;Manages community grants and future Push ecosystem grants.</li>
<li><strong>Push Council:</strong>&nbsp;Oversees budgets for all subDAOs and the DAO itself.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Anyone can propose Push Improvement Proposals (PIPs) to improve the protocol.</li>
<li>Initiatives are voted on and implemented seasonally (monthly or quarterly).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Takeaway:</strong></p>
<p>Push DAO is a community-driven force, empowering Push Protocol's growth and future direction.</p>

<p><a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/epns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="$PUSH at Coinmarketcap.com"><strong><em><code>$PUSH</code></em></strong></a> is the native token of the Push Network and it will be used to enable several key functions of the network apart from the already existing utilities defined in the current tokenomics.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Staking for Push Validator Nodes</strong>
Push Validator Nodes are going to be the computational backbone of the Push Network. They will be responsible for validating the network and ensuring that the network is secure and reliable. They are also responsible for penalizing and kicking out bad actors from the network.</li>
</ol>
<p>Running a Push Validator Node will require staking a certain amount of <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/epns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="$PUSH at Coinmarketcap.com"><strong><em><code>$PUSH</code></em></strong></a> tokens along with having a domain name and a server to run   the node.</p>

<p>March was a productive month for us at the Push Ecosystem. We achieved some significant milestones that we’re excited to share with you.</p>
<p>We sent out over 4 million notifications and reached 174,000 subscribers. But our journey doesn’t stop here. Let’s dive into the exciting updates for March from the Push Ecosystem:</p>

<p>We introduced the Push <a href="https://app.push.org/?/snap" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MetaMask Snooze Snap</a>, which allows users to snooze notifications for up to 72 hours.

<p>Push Protocol recently unveiled Push Nodes, paving way for Push to become blockchain of communication and unleashing a new era for Web3 communication.</p>
<p>With the public launch of Push Nodes getting closer, we are excited to unveil the new economic engine of the <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/epns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="$PUSH at Coinmarketcap.com"><strong><em><code>$PUSH</code></em></strong></a> token that will sit at the core of securing, decentralizing and incentiving the Push Network.</p>

<p>Push Validator Nodes are going to be the computational backbone of the Push Network. They will be responsible for validating the network and ensuring that the network is secure and reliable. They are also responsible for penalizing and kicking out bad actors from the network.</p>
<p>Running a Push Validator Nodes will require staking a certain amount of <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/epns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="$PUSH at Coinmarketcap.com"><strong><em><code>$PUSH</code></em></strong></a> tokens along with having a domain name and a server to run the node.</p>

<p>We will be updating the tokenomics page and open a discourse thread for the community to also share their thoughts and feedback soon! Let's Push the boundaries of Web3 together <!-- -->❤️<!-- -->!</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>We’re extremely excited to announce that Push Nodes are here! An all-new decentralized infrastructure for web3’s leading communication layer, the Push Protocol Network.</p>
<p>This new and improved decentralized infrastructure for Push is a long-awaited move that we’re only now executing thanks to extensive research and development.</p>
<p>So what does this new decentralized infrastructure look like?</p>
<p>In this article, we'll explore:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is decentralization in web3 and how will the new Push Network look</li>
<li>Exploring types of nodes and explanation of Push Nodes</li>
<li>Why is it necessary</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="understanding-different-types-of-decentralization---which-will-push-become">Understanding Different Types of Decentralization - Which Will Push Become<a href="https://push.org/blog/explaining-push-nodes#understanding-different-types-of-decentralization---which-will-push-become" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Understanding Different Types of Decentralization - Which Will Push Become" title="Direct link to Understanding Different Types of Decentralization - Which Will Push Become">​</a></h3>
<p>Decentralization can mean different things depending who you ask because it is a very complex topic that can exist in many different forms and structures. This is why many modern blockchains and protocols have tight discussions on what it means to be fully decentralized.</p>
<p>So to begin with, we’ll explore the different types of architecture at a high level as a way of best communicating what Push is working towards</p>
<p>Client-Server – Linear system <br>
Distributed – Different nodes hold different responsibilities and contribute to one another <br>
Peer-toPeer – Data is passed directly from user to user with no intermediaries<br>
Decentralized – Collective and shared control over data and decision making<br></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="First Image of Explaining Push Nodes: Everything You Need To Know" src="https://push.org/assets/images/image-1-cc99b36c89e8bfc06d5a59b599e5d50c.webp" width="1160" height="652" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>As we’ve outlined in the image above, Push is moving towards the right. A fully decentralized network wherein no single node or entity has complete control of the network. Access is open and shared.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, decentralization can also be applied at different layers of an organization. Just as you can decentralize software architecture, you too can decentralize teams and organizational structures (DAOs).</p>
<p>While the Push Network already has a DAO and $PUSH token, we are now taking the final step towards decentralization by decentralizing our software architecture, completing what you might call ‘full stack decentralization’.</p>
<p>Our goal is to build a permissionless, trustless, proof-of-stake protocol with different node types that provide a decentralized API for notifications processing, indexing, and delivery. Ultimately, we’re aiming to wrap the whole system in a developer-friendly SDK package and a dApp that can leverage the power of this network.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="push-nodes-as-the-key-how-do-they-work">Push Nodes As The Key: How Do They Work<a href="https://push.org/blog/explaining-push-nodes#push-nodes-as-the-key-how-do-they-work" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Push Nodes As The Key: How Do They Work" title="Direct link to Push Nodes As The Key: How Do They Work">​</a></h3>
<p>The Push Network will comprise three different types of Nodes. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Validator nodes - Batching notifications into blocks, validating them, and providing all the required APIs for SDK</li>
<li>Storage nodes - Indexing notifications</li>
<li>Delivery nodes - Sending notifications to the end-user device based on his/her 0xwallet, not his/her hardware credentials.</li>
</ul>
<p>The network is guarded by a smart contract to maintain node staking and slashing. This is where the PUSH token is used.</p>
<p>In our proposed architecture, the storage network is sharded by a smart contract, which assigns specific shards to specific nodes to ensure a high amount of redundancy. This is done on top of storage nodes.</p>
<p>We’re targeting fast delivery of ~15s on average for delivery of Notifications.</p>
<p>Abstract architecture</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Second Image of Explaining Push Nodes: Everything You Need To Know" src="https://push.org/assets/images/image-2-f582d599b661dca47be6741aee109046.webp" width="1160" height="652" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>The basic use-case:</p>
<p>A javascript SDK locates the right validator, posts a notification, and this notification will be included in the block. The block list of validator nodes for processing is determined by a combined network random number (randao).</p>
<p>A more detailed version of the architecture looks like this:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Third Image of Explaining Push Nodes: Everything You Need To Know" src="https://push.org/assets/images/image-3-284130ae22160c8ce52d0c9e8af25261.webp" width="1160" height="647" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>We’ll now explore each of the three Node types in more detail.</p>

<p>Every validator can be slashed, in case his vote on the new block differs from the majority of their validators, which voted for the block as valid.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Fourth Image of Explaining Push Nodes: Everything You Need To Know" src="https://push.org/assets/images/image-4-60068ed2b000a58006e79291b702234f.webp" width="1157" height="647" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="storage-nodes">Storage nodes<a href="https://push.org/blog/explaining-push-nodes#storage-nodes" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Storage nodes" title="Direct link to Storage nodes">​</a></h4>
<p>Originally, Push Storage Nodes validate and index all communications and link them to a user’s wallet address and multi-chain identity.</p>
<p>The new Push decentralized system maps every wallet notification data to a specific shard.</p>
<p>This shard maintains X copies in the network. The smart contract dynamically computes x.
Whenever new nodes join, the contract recomputes which storage nodes are assigned to which shards.</p>

<p>Delivery nodes are a pivotal component of the decentralized Push Notification infrastructure. They ensure notifications are securely and efficiently delivered to the end-user’s device while serving as a decentralized solution for connecting web3 and web2. These nodes can be hosted by trusted third parties, bringing reliability and professionalism to the system. Their operation hinges on a few key principles and functionalities:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Integration with Established APIs</b>: To leverage robust, widely-accepted infrastructure for sending Push Notifications.</li>
<li><b>Privacy-Centric Mapping</b>: To maintain the privacy and security of the users, delivery nodes store a mapping between a registered crypto wallet and the end-user device ID.</li>
<li><b>Hosting by Trusted Entities</b>: Recognizing the importance of reliability and trust in the notification delivery process, delivery nodes can be hosted by trusted third parties.</li>
<li><b>Collaboration with Wallet Providers</b>: In addition to being hosted by trusted third parties, delivery nodes can also be hosted by wallet providers themselves. This collaboration brings an added layer of integration and convenience, as wallet providers have a direct interest in ensuring that their users receive notifications promptly and securely.</li>
</ul>

<p>We believe that communication tools should be a public good. Builders should have open and free access to enhance their dApps with web3-native communication, without needing to rely on centralized providers.</p>
<p>As an extension of this, those same builders should not just have access to these tools, but a say in how these tools get developed and improved over time.</p>
<p>As the accessibility of these tools grows, so does the quality of dApps that build with them. When we achieve the goal of building better projects, we move closer towards a reality where we can onboard the next billion users to web3.</p>
<p>We are excited for this new era for the Push Protocol Network and we are extremely excited to have you be a part of it.</p>
