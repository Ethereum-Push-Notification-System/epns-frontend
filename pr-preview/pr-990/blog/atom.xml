<p><strong>Interact with any non-evm app, without leaving zkLink</strong></p>
<p>Push Chain extends the aggregation capabilities of zkLink enabling zkLink users to easily interact with and explore non-evm ecosystems like Solana, Aptos and Cosmos - all without leaving the operational comfort offered by zkLink.</p>
<p>No need to create new wallets, learn and follow complex bridging steps- simply utilize Push Chain to seamlessly interplay between zkLink and the non-evm ecosystem</p>
<p><strong>Unified Experience</strong></p>
<p>Since zkLink aggregates Ethereum networks and serves as a unified point of access, users from non-evm space can easily leverage Push Chain to explore and interact with EVM space- abstracting away all the manual complexities traditionally faced by non-EVM users when transacting on EVM chains.</p>
<p>All of the above with the advantage of - instant finality, security and superfast execution.</p>

<p><strong>Build super abstracted - shared settlement apps</strong></p>
<p>With shared settlement capabilities of Push Chain and zkLink - devs can build apps with powerful chain, fee and wallet abstraction capabilities - allowing transactions from any chain with near-instant finality.</p>
<p><strong>Build universally compliant consumer and mixed financial apps</strong></p>
<p>Push Chain introduces a new transaction type: <strong>‚Äòconsumer transactions‚Äô</strong>, where transaction ordering is not essential.</p>
<p>Why consumer tx?</p>
<p>Two major challenges hinder the scalability of consumer web3 apps:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Chain Fragmentation:</strong> User bases are over-diversified across hundreds of chains, impeding user growth, UX and retention.</li>
<li><strong>Scalability constraints</strong> Most chains process transactions in a strictly ordered manner, which imposes unnecessary constraints on apps that don‚Äôt rely on transaction ordering.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is where Push Chain‚Äôs Consumer Tx feature enables non-financial and consumer applications to operate with lightning-fast speed and hyper-scalability. Push Chain enables these apps to manage millions of users seamlessly across any chain environment.</p>

<p>After tapping into over 300,000 wallets and sending over 100 million notifications we thought - <strong><em>how about sending on-chain notifications directly to your email or telegram?</em></strong></p>
<p>This helps Push Communications to reach billions of everyday Email and TG users while paving the way for much smoother onboarding for web2 normies and budding web2 users.</p>
<p>Now, users can receive web3 notifications from over 500 DApps straight to their Telegram or email accounts - no need to connect a wallet or endure various friction points while entering the web3 space. Simply, connect your TG and Email and receive notifs.</p>

<p>Push DAO witnessed extraordinary exposure and participation in 2024.</p>
<p>With hundreds of new participants, over 50 regular contributors, global exposure, quality grantees, and tremendous support from the Push Fam community, we've made exceptional progress.</p>
<p>In June 2024, we launched Push DAO V2 to advance our journey toward progressive decentralization.
This new framework, supported by the DAO Council, streamlines engagement for contributors and builders.</p>
<p>The launch of our <strong>Push Grants Program V3</strong> empowered both, early-stage and established projects building innovative social, gaming, and mobile apps. This initiative has driven impressive results‚Äîincreasing grant applications tenfold and multiplying our active grantees five times over since the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>Our Push DAO BD SubDAO Program now offers rewards ranging from <strong>$500‚Äì$1500</strong> for successful integrations of Push Notifications/Chat with DAOs, DeFi protocols, dApps, and other projects. Through our council and contributors' dedicated efforts, this program has generated over 80 qualified leads for our ecosystem.</p>
<p>Our revamped ambassador programs have reached new heights of influence, establishing a student hub at <strong>Texas Tech University</strong> and forming connections with event organizers across more than four continents.</p>
<p>As we prepare to launch Push Chain, our DAO stands ready to make a significant impact on the ecosystem and beyond. Our core team brings together professionals with cross-industry expertise, while our current and prospective grantees span key industry sectors.
Having achieved extraordinary growth in less than a year, we're positioned for even greater achievements in 2025.</p>
<p>With our coordinated event and marketing strategy for the launch in place, you can expect to see the DAO everywhere next year, driving the chain's progress.</p>
<p>With hundreds of new contributors, global exposures, quality grantees and a lot of love from the Push Fam community!</p>
<p>To continue our journey of Push DAO towards progressive decentralisation we introduced a new DAO framework, <a href="https://gov.push.org/t/push-dao-v2-push-dao-council/1631" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Push DAO V2</a>. This framework simplifies the process for contributors and builders to engage with the DAO, with the support of the DAO Council.</p>

<p>After years of building one of the first consumer apps in web3, one key takeaway we learnt, was the pressing need for a consumer app-centric chain capable of unifying the entire web3 ecosystem under a shared state.</p>
<p>This realization inspired the creation of <a href="https://push.org/chain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Push Chain</a> - <strong>a shared-state Layer 1 blockchain that unifies the settlement of all the incredible L1s, L2s, and L3s, enabling any user from any chain to access any app through one unified shared state.</strong></p>

<p>Push fam, we know you were extremely eager for Push Nodes, after its announcement early, this year.</p>
<p>Unlike most of the L1s, Push Chain too is a Proof Of Stake network - but with its own innovative flavour.</p>
<p>Push Chain splits the nodes into three types - Validator, Storage and Archival and enables a node governance smart contract that keeps track of all the nodes that are present in the network.</p>
<p><strong>Validator nodes</strong> - Responsible for validating transactions;</p>
<p><strong>Storage nodes</strong> - Dynamically shard data based on the hash of blockchain-agnostic addresses and store it; and</p>
<p><strong>Archival nodes</strong> - Maintain a full snapshot of all transactions on the network.</p>
<p>Push Chain also introduced <strong>Node Registry Smart Contracts</strong> a key innovation that : - Registers nodes. - Manage dynamic sharding. - Set replication factors. - Enable parallel validators that scale dynamically with the number of nodes in the network and thus achieve <strong>True Scale</strong>!</p>

<p>‚Üí 1. <strong>Blockchain agnostic wallet addresses</strong></p>
<p>‚Üí 2. <strong>Support Txns from any chain</strong></p>
<p>‚Üí 3. <strong>Fee Abstraction</strong></p>
<p>‚Üí 4. <strong>Wallet Abstraction</strong></p>
<p>‚Üí 5. <strong>Consumer (Unordered) and Traditional (Ordered) Transactions</strong></p>

<p>‚Üí 9. <strong>Push ID</strong></p>
<p>‚Üí 10. <strong>Universal Smart Contracts and Shared State</strong></p>
<p>Let‚Äôs take a closer look at each of these innovations and enhancements</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="innovations-by-push-chain">Innovations By Push Chain<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-990/blog/innovations-by-push-chain#innovations-by-push-chain" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Innovations By Push Chain" title="Direct link to Innovations By Push Chain">‚Äã</a></h2>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="1-blockchain-agnostic-wallet-addresses">1. Blockchain agnostic wallet addresses<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-990/blog/innovations-by-push-chain#1-blockchain-agnostic-wallet-addresses" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1. Blockchain agnostic wallet addresses" title="Direct link to 1. Blockchain agnostic wallet addresses">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>For Apps to support users from any chain and achieve <strong>universal compatibility</strong> - there must be a way to identify, interpret and transact with addresses incoming from various chains.</p>
<p>As a shared-state blockchain, Push Chain is designed to parse and handle blockchain addresses alongside the specific chains they originate from.</p>
<p>For instance, Push Chain can identify and support Solana, EVM, Cosmos and any other chain‚Äôs addresses.
To achieve this, Push Chain fully adopts <a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/main/CAIPs/caip-10.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CAIP-10</a> blockchain-agnostic wallet addresses, enabling it to deduce the chain, network, and address associated with each transaction ensuring universal compatibility across multiple blockchain ecosystems.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="2-support-txns-from-any-chain">2. Support Txns from any chain<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-990/blog/innovations-by-push-chain#2-support-txns-from-any-chain" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2. Support Txns from any chain" title="Direct link to 2. Support Txns from any chain">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>In addition to parsing addresses across various chains, Push Chain supports transactions from any wallet, regardless of the originating chain‚Äîbe it Ethereum, Solana, or any other network.</p>
<p>Push Chain achieves this by accepting signed payload data and supporting the native signers of individual chains. Validator nodes then verify these signatures ‚Üí conduct pre-transaction checks (such as fee validation) ‚Üí and then admit the transactions to the network.</p>
<p>To clarify, a user doesn‚Äôt have to ‚Äúbridge‚Äù to another chain to use our platform. Instead, the app becomes universal and available to all users of any chain.</p>
<p>Push Chain also introduces a new mechanism called <strong>Push ID</strong> to create a consistent and unified interface for users, no matter which wallet they use.</p>
<p><strong><em>More on Push ID below...</em></strong></p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="3-fee-abstraction">3. Fee Abstraction<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-990/blog/innovations-by-push-chain#3-fee-abstraction" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 3. Fee Abstraction" title="Direct link to 3. Fee Abstraction">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>With web3‚Äôs progression towards true interoperability, the necessity to hold native tokens for basic interactions creates unnecessary barriers in what should be a borderless ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>Push Chain‚Äôs Fee Abstraction eliminates these digital borders, ensuring universal accessibility and removing the economic friction of owning native tokens for network fees.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Onchain Swappers</strong>: Fee contracts on every chain convert native tokens to cover fees automatically‚Äîno explicit swaps for Push Chain‚Äôs tokens are required.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bulk Fee Payments</strong>: Lock and release fees in bulk, then send them to Push Chain directly in the transaction. This removes the bottleneck of waiting on a specific blockchain‚Äôs speed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Delegated Fees</strong>: Wallets or web3 apps can cover fees, enabling a web2-like UX where the ‚Äúwebsite‚Äù pays for the user.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These mechanisms bridge web2 paradigms into web3 enabling web2 UX in a web3 world -</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Pay-for-content models</strong>: Apps like Facebook and Instagram cover user interaction fees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Freemium models</strong>: Apps absorb user costs temporarily, enabling users to later pay in bulk for services after experiencing them for free (e.g., Spotify, Google Drive).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Push Chain makes these models possible, creating a frictionless experience and paving the way for building universal apps with borderless shared experiences.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="4-wallet-abstraction">4. Wallet abstraction<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-990/blog/innovations-by-push-chain#4-wallet-abstraction" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 4. Wallet abstraction" title="Direct link to 4. Wallet abstraction">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>At a higher level, there are two user personas in web3:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Degens (aka existing web3 users)</strong> - Well accustomed to the fragmented UX, have app &amp; chain specific preferences for every on-chain activity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Normies (aka new web3 users)</strong> - New or casual users unfamiliar with web3 complexities - Struggle with the manual and often complicated process of setting up a wallet.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With the rapid proliferation of L1s, L2s and L3s, the UX gap between Degens and Normies is widening, creating a disproportionate balance in user experiences.</p>
<p><strong>Push Chain‚Äôs Wallet Abstraction diminishes this divide by creating a balanced ground for every web3 user persona.</strong></p>
<p>Wallet abstraction provides a flexible, <strong>embeddable wallet experience</strong>, tailored to individual user journeys enabling any wallet from any chain to connect, interact and transact with Push Chain.</p>
<p><strong>Existing Web3 Users?</strong></p>
<p>Already using Ethereum, Solana, or another chain? Push Wallet lets you continue using your existing setup‚Äîno extra hoops. Combined with fee abstraction, transactions stay native to the source blockchain, making cross-chain use effortless.</p>
<p><strong>New Web3 Users (Web2 Normies)?</strong></p>
<p>Not web3-savvy? No problem. Just log in with an email or social account. Under the hood, the wallet uses sharding and pass keys to stay non-custodial but feels as simple and intuitive as web2.</p>
<p><strong>For users logging in via email or social platforms</strong>, Push Chain ensures security and non-custodial functionality through key sharding. The user‚Äôs credentials are divided into three encrypted shards stored across the Push Backend (trusted), local storage (encrypted via a passkey), and Push Chain (also encrypted via a passkey). This approach allows key reconstruction only when accessed by the user, providing a secure yet user-friendly experience that bridges the gap between web2 familiarity and web3 security.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="5-consumer-unordered-and-traditional-ordered-transactions">5. Consumer (Unordered) and Traditional (Ordered) Transactions<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-990/blog/innovations-by-push-chain#5-consumer-unordered-and-traditional-ordered-transactions" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 5. Consumer (Unordered) and Traditional (Ordered) Transactions" title="Direct link to 5. Consumer (Unordered) and Traditional (Ordered) Transactions">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>Present web3 infra is heavily skewed towards financial apps that require strict ordering of transactions and precise state accuracy.
However consumer apps, on the other hand, are inclined towards more flexible, faster and parallel transaction needs.
Consumer apps are made of two primary elements where:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Order is necessary (user payments, financial instruments) and</em></li>
<li><em>Order is not critical (messages, comments or likes on a post, retweet, chat, email, gameplay, etc.).</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Traditional chains don‚Äôt provide the right experience for such use cases forcing consumer apps to make suboptimal compromises impacting their performance and usability.</p>
<p><strong><em>Could there be a way of supporting consumer actions in an unordered, parallel and yet decentralised manner?</em></strong></p>
<p>Absolutely yes! This is where <strong>Push Chain innovates a new transaction type - Consumer Transaction</strong>- which instantly unlocks non-financial, mixed-financial apps for web3 helping consumer apps reach faster PMF.</p>
<p>Managing hyper-scalable apps with thousands of parallel transactions on-chain - is not easy.
Push Chain makes it possible using its new innovation - <strong>True Scale</strong>.</p>
<p>With True Scale, Push Chain's network capacity and its read-write throughput grow organically, as more nodes join its consensus.
This enables parallel execution of thousands of consumer transactions, near-instant finality and quicker information storage and retrieval.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs how the Push Chain achieves true scale.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="6-true-scale-sub-second-finality-speed">6. True Scale: Sub second finality (speed)<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-990/blog/innovations-by-push-chain#6-true-scale-sub-second-finality-speed" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 6. True Scale: Sub second finality (speed)" title="Direct link to 6. True Scale: Sub second finality (speed)">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>Push Chain splits the nodes into three types - <strong>Validator, Storage and Archival</strong> and enables a node governance smart contract that keeps track of all the nodes that are present in the network.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Validator Nodes</strong> - Responsible for validating transactions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Storage Nodes</strong> - Dynamically shard data based on the hash of blockchain-agnostic addresses and store it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Archival Nodes</strong> - Maintain a full snapshot of all transactions on the network.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These role-specific nodes enable parallel validation to be done on any type of consumer transaction ensuring near-instant finality.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> All txs (write or read) are attested by random validators/storage nodes ensuring that malicious nodes result in slashing.</p>
<p><strong>Node Registry Smart Contract:</strong> Push Chain employs a registry smart contract to register these nodes, manage dynamic sharding, set replication factors, and enable parallel validators that scale dynamically with the number of nodes in the network. This approach ensures linear scaling, allowing the network to handle increased read and write demands efficiently as it grows.</p>
<p>Because of these different nodes and smart contract setting up parallel validators, the tx sent to the network can land on any of the <em>‚Äòn‚Äô</em> number of parallel validators which are then instantly moved to processing (250ms block), this is what enables sub-second finality for Push Chain.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="7-true-scale-parallel-validators-scaling-write-throughput">7. True Scale: Parallel validators (scaling write throughput)<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-990/blog/innovations-by-push-chain#7-true-scale-parallel-validators-scaling-write-throughput" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 7. True Scale: Parallel validators (scaling write throughput)" title="Direct link to 7. True Scale: Parallel validators (scaling write throughput)">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>Push Chain achieves true scaling of write transactions, particularly for consumer transactions, where the consumer txs are packed in unordered blocks (or should we call them <strong>stateless blocks</strong>!? ).</p>
<p>Allowing these transactions to be processed through any active validator node promises near-instant finality, and the write throughput (or TPS) of the chain increases linearly as the number of nodes in the network grows.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="8-true-scale-dynamic-sharding-scaling-read-throughput">8. True Scale: Dynamic Sharding (scaling read throughput)<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-990/blog/innovations-by-push-chain#8-true-scale-dynamic-sharding-scaling-read-throughput" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 8. True Scale: Dynamic Sharding (scaling read throughput)" title="Direct link to 8. True Scale: Dynamic Sharding (scaling read throughput)">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p><strong>Push Chain achieves true scaling of reading transactions by implementing dynamic sharding on storage nodes.</strong></p>
<p>Data chunks within each shard are mapped to blockchain-agnostic addresses and are dynamically redistributed as new storage nodes are added to the network.</p>
<p>In addition, the chain introduces a node governing smart contract onto which each node (regardless of the type) is registered before getting admitted to the network. Since this node-registry smart contract knows the number of nodes in the network, it is able to dynamically shard and assign data chunks and replication factors ensuring the network is fast and becomes faster in retrieving data as new nodes are added.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="9-push-id">9. Push ID<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-990/blog/innovations-by-push-chain#9-push-id" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 9. Push ID" title="Direct link to 9. Push ID">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>In a universal chain like Push Chain - One essential element for bringing shared app experiences to users is the ability to track users‚Äô on-chain identity - and not just their wallets.</p>
<p>One user may have multiple wallets, spanning various chains and ecosystems whether EVM or nonEVM.
This led us to create the unified Push ID, giving each user one identity that spans all their wallets, both EVM and non-EVM. Instead of tying interactions strictly to a single wallet, transactions are now accredited to a user‚Äôs Push ID.</p>
<p>The Push ID mapping allows for reverse lookups guaranteeing a consistent and unified interface for users, no matter which wallet they use. developers can fetch, index, and understand a user‚Äôs full spectrum of interactions across chains, all mapped to one identity.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="10-shared-state-and-universal-smart-contracts">10.

<p><strong>Shared State</strong></p>
<p>With Push ID and Any Chain Tx, we realized that accessing a wallet‚Äôs state across different blockchains is a game changer.</p>
<p>One thing that‚Äôs missing over here though was the ability to get the individual state of all the wallets which in essence will allow smart contracts to know the entire state of individual wallet(s) that are connected to the user. This feature is what we call a Shared state.</p>
<p><strong>Shared state allows Push Chain to access data from its own chain as well as supported external chains!</strong></p>
<p>With shared state, you can read wallet activities like NFTs, DeFi positions, governance participation, and so much more!</p>
<p><strong>Universal Smart Contracts</strong></p>
<p>A shared state chain is essential to enable shared app experiences. This chain must have the ability to read the state of wallets across other chains, facilitating universal smart contracts and creating an ecosystem where users from any chain‚Äîor even web2‚Äîcan interact seamlessly. Such a chain would provide shared settlement across both EVM and non-EVM chains, ushering in an era of universal apps and shared experiences.</p>
<p>Using shared state in VM, Push allows developers to write universal smart contracts with which universal app experiences become possible. Users, regardless of their origin‚Äîwhether from any chain or ecosystem‚Äîcan effortlessly interact with consumer apps that prioritize user engagement without regard to how or where they enter the system.</p>
<p>Ultimately, <strong>Universal Smart Contracts and the ability to interact with all chains through Push Chain and represent our ultimate goal: Eliminating Web3 friction and delivering the best shared app experience possible.</strong></p>

<p>Push Protocol has come a long way! We‚Äôve delivered over 140M notifications, built a community of 500K aggregate users, powered notifications for 500+ projects, and are known as the de facto leader in notifications and communications for web3.
We took the biggest and the most ambitious step in its history last week and have launched governance for its evolution to Push Chain, a shared state blockchain for building universal applications. It is a sharded Proof of Stake (PoS) chain built to allow developers to create user-centric app experiences and act as a shared settlement layer for multiple L1s, L2s, L3s.</p>
<p>The journey often matters more than the destination, and we couldn‚Äôt agree more. From our beginnings at ETHGlobal 2020, to becoming an EF alumnus, ranking as a top 5 project in Gitcoin Grants, securing funding from leading VCs and angels, inventing the communication stack for web3, and now launching a consumer-centric L1 to unify web3 - each milestone has shaped our path and brought us here. Buckle up, it's time to reminisce!</p>

<p>We started with an idea for Push Protocol and web3. The thesis was that protocols in web3 only interact with wallet addresses and thus it made sense to build a notification and communication system that can inform these wallets.</p>

<p>One of the best feelings we had was when we participated in Gitcoin Grants and the community came together to fund us out. This was in many ways the first check that we saw after we had started building Push (then EPNS).</p>
<p>There‚Äôs serenity in making something that gets loved by the people for whom you are building and is the best feeling that any entrepreneur can have. To us, these 214 contributors is what made everything we had done so far worthwhile!</p>

<p>Making it into Kernel was a dream come true. I still remember the joy I felt when we were selected.

<p>We submitted this but then stressed out on if we were rude or missed the context of the question. Thankfully, Vivek, Sachin and team embraced our web3 vibe wholeheartedly.</p>

<p>The next phase of our journey was to start sending web3 notifications and we had a chicken and egg problem over here. Notifications are useful for wallets to show if popular protocols are sending them but for popular protocols to embrace web3 notifs, wallets need to integrate them üò±.</p>
<p>We took a chance and reached out to some of the best and top protocols in the space back then, hint: they still are the leaders! They were the ones who helped us crack this chicken and egg problem and solidified our conviction on why web3 is the future - it‚Äôs because each one of them is trying to expand the boundaries of web3.</p>

<p>We now realize that apart from inventing the communication protocol for web3, we also were building one of the first consumer app for it which was non-financial in nature and was driven by the utility it offered to average user than the 10x other financial apps promised (and thus, user was incentivized to learn web3 broken ux).</p>
<p>This realization helped us in paving forward an app that is useful and frictionless for the web3 user and enabled us to identify the features that we wanted as we moved towards decentralizing our notification nodes.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="building-for-scalability-and-speed">Building for scalability and speed<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-990/blog/evolution-of-push#building-for-scalability-and-speed" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Building for scalability and speed" title="Direct link to Building for scalability and speed">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>We realized very quickly that notification unlike traditional transactions needs to be scalable. It needed an infra that can scale up and maintain speed. To enable this, we built out a solution involving dynamic sharding, ensuring that the solution scales up as more notifications and wallets join in.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="inventing-consumer-tx-by-accident">Inventing consumer tx by accident!<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-990/blog/evolution-of-push#inventing-consumer-tx-by-accident" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Inventing consumer tx by accident!" title="Direct link to Inventing consumer tx by accident!">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>While building our notification nodes for write throughput, ie: handling tens of thousands of parallel notifications. We came up with the architecture of having parallel validators, since having order in notifications was not required.</p>
<p>This paved the way for parallel validators where notifications can be sent to any validators which will then form stateless blocks (or unordered blocks). We didn‚Äôt know back then but we had unlocked a massive innovation in web3, having txs where ordering is not critical. This later formed the backbone of Push Chain‚Äôs speed and linear scalability.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="building-for-seamless-web3-ux">Building for seamless web3 UX<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-990/blog/evolution-of-push#building-for-seamless-web3-ux" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Building for seamless web3 UX" title="Direct link to Building for seamless web3 UX">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>Another thing that we wanted our notification protocol to have was a seamless onboarding process where the user can just sign in once and then, just like web2, they are not required to sign things again and again. Our Chat Protocol and PGP implementation helped us realize and solve for the most seamless web3 UX. Later on, this learning was transformed into wallet and fee abstraction for Push Chain.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="building-for-unification-of-web3">Building for unification of web3<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-990/blog/evolution-of-push#building-for-unification-of-web3" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Building for unification of web3" title="Direct link to Building for unification of web3">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>And finally, we wanted this to be the communication protocol of web3, where notifications and chat can come to Push as a universal hub. Where, protocols from Ethereum, Polygon, Solana, Aptos, or any other EVM or non-EVM are able to come together in a seamless interoperable way.</p>
<p>This is not bridging, as bridging moves funds or assets from one chain to another. But, instead it‚Äôs unification or having a universal hub. A place where users from all chains come together. This feature is what was transformed to Push Chain as being the universal hub for all chains, where transactions from any chain are supported, where shared state of all wallets are available, where all L1s, L2s and L3s can come together and use Push as a shared settlement layer.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="rebranding-to-become-the-communication-protocol-of-web3">Rebranding to become the communication protocol of web3<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-990/blog/evolution-of-push#rebranding-to-become-the-communication-protocol-of-web3" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Rebranding to become the communication protocol of web3" title="Direct link to Rebranding to become the communication protocol of web3">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>We started building notifications for web3 under the brand of Ethereum Push Notification Service (EPNS) which made sense when we started since Apple also names their notification service as Apple Push Notification Service (APNS).</p>
<p>But as we dived deep and started building the features for enabling notifications, chat. We quickly became aware that a non-Ethereum developer might be confused by the name EPNS. Thus, we decided to rebrand to Push, we picked this name because:</p>
<ul>
<li>We were now placed to become the communication protocol of web3, so <b>Ethereum</b> had to go from <b>Ethereum Push Notification Service</b>.</li>
<li>We were not doing just notification, but instead had chat among other communication tools so <b>Notification</b> had to go from <b>Push Notification Service.</b></li>
<li>And lastly, we were not a service but a decentralized protocol of web3, so <b>Service</b> had to go from <b>Push Service</b>.</li>
<li>Leading us to rebrand to <b>Push</b>.</li>
</ul>

<p>During building for our vision of the most perfect consumer app and the decentralized notification protocol and nodes out. We eventually realized that what we have built instead is far more significant and solves for the seamless web3 that we all dream of.</p>
<p>This realization is what turned into our shared state blockchain - Push Chain, which while being an L1, is not just another L1 as it‚Äôs built to be used by users of any other chain without them needing to switch or bridge to this chain. It‚Äôs the future of web3 built for unification, consumer and universal apps and seamless onboarding.</p>

<p>This has led us to launching our proposal of Push Chain, which just to recap is a shared state L1 blockchain for shared app experiences. Push Chain enables txs from any chain (Solana, Eth, EVM, or non-EVM) with fast finality of &lt;1 second and can scale infinitely as nodes increase, supporting tens of thousands of parallel transactions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Push Chain introduces groundbreaking features including:</li>
<li>Ability to do any chain tx</li>
<li>Introduces a new tx type - Consumer transaction (order not important)</li>
<li>Provides wallet and fee abstraction for a seamless user experience</li>
<li>Enables true scale with parallel validators and dynamic sharding</li>
<li>Able to do &lt;1 second finality</li>
<li>Utilizes universal smart contracts - capable of accessing the state of a wallet belonging to a different chain</li>

<p>Web 3 is growing at lightning speed!</p>
<p>Hundreds of L1s, Thousands of L2s and soon Tens of thousands of L3s!!</p>
<p>While striving to make systems more scalable, decentralized and secure, we risk overlooking a crucial goal - <strong>To expand the boundaries of web3 for all users.</strong></p>
<p>And with increasing fragmentation coupled with complex pre-requisites to interact on-chain, inflexible infrastructure for consumer apps, and a lack of chain unification, the barrier to entry is rising, leading to the emergence of more closed and isolated systems.</p>
<p>But not anymore.</p>
<p><strong>Introducing Push Chain - A shared state blockchain for shared app experiences!</strong></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="what-is-push-chain">What is Push Chain?<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-990/blog/consumer-apps-that-can-be-built-on-push-chain#what-is-push-chain" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is Push Chain?" title="Direct link to What is Push Chain?">‚Äã</a></h2>
<p>Push Chain is a Proof of Stake shared state blockchain designed to support the development of hyper-scalable, consumer-centric, universal web3 applications by unifying settlement from any L1s, L2s and L3s.</p>

<p>Push Chain‚Äôs development follows a phased approach:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Phase-1:</strong> Focuses on creating an infrastructure tailored for consumer-centric applications  ‚Äî enables building true scale apps, supports transaction from any chain, vm for smarter / complex applications, consumer transaction (ordering is not important), fees abstraction - enabling fees from a chain of user choice or from web3 app, wallet abstraction - social login and login from any other chain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Phase-2:</strong> Establishes seamless interoperability between blockchains, enabling instant cross-chain transactions and the transfer of value and smart contract calls. This phase introduces a solver network designed to enhance user experience by abstracting on-chain complexities by facilitating hyper-scalable and universal applications</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Phase-3:</strong> Introduces Universal smart contract and shared state ‚Äî enabling seamless cross-blockchain interactions and making other chain‚Äôs state accessible on Push Chain and unlocking the era of universal apps.</p>
