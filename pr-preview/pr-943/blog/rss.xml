<p>Web 3 is growing at lightning speed!</p>
<p>Hundreds of L1s, Thousands of L2s and soon Tens of thousands of L3s!!</p>
<p>While striving to make systems more scalable, decentralized and secure, we risk overlooking a crucial goal - <strong>To expand the boundaries of web3 for all users.</strong></p>
<p>And with increasing fragmentation coupled with complex pre-requisites to interact on-chain, inflexible infrastructure for consumer apps, and a lack of chain unification, the barrier to entry is rising, leading to the emergence of more closed and isolated systems.</p>
<p>But not anymore.</p>
<p><strong>Introducing Push Chain - A shared state blockchain for shared app experiences!</strong></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="what-is-push-chain">What is Push Chain?<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-943/blog/consumer-apps-that-can-be-built-on-push-chain#what-is-push-chain" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is Push Chain?" title="Direct link to What is Push Chain?">‚Äã</a></h2>

<p>Push Chain is a shared state blockchain for universal applications. It is designed to allow <strong>transactions from any chain</strong> (ETH, Solana, EVM, non-EVM), has <strong>&lt;1s fast finality</strong> and has <strong>true scalability</strong> (read and write throughput increases as the number of nodes increases).</p>
<p>It introduces some ground breaking innovations such as <strong>consumer txs</strong> (order not important), <strong>parallel validators and dynamic sharding</strong> and <strong>universal smart contracts</strong>. The result is a layer 1 with the ability to become a shared settlement layer for all L1s ü§ù L2s ü§ù L3.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Push Chain Architecture" src="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-943/assets/images/pcoverview-ef4ca9321077a31148211c9aec3f84c2.webp" title="Push Chain Architecture" width="1600" height="1432" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Push Chain is a sharded, Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain that features different types of nodes‚Äîvalidators, storage nodes, and archival nodes‚Äîeach optimized for specific roles and responsibilities to ensure high efficiency. This design gives the chain fast finality of less than one second.</p>
<p>In brief, <strong>Validator</strong> nodes handle the role of writing transactions and are able to do so in parallel. <strong>Storage</strong> nodes, which are dynamically sharded, fetch transactions from the network. And <strong>Archival</strong> nodes provide a complete snapshot of the blockchain.</p>
<p>Push Chain also introduces several key innovations in web3. At launch, these include <strong>consumer transactions</strong> (these are txs where order is not critical), <strong>Push ID</strong>, which maps multiple EVM and non-EVM accounts and <strong>wallet and fees abstraction</strong>.</p>
<p>In later phases, Push Chain will introduce <strong>shared state</strong> and <strong>universal smart contracts</strong>. These features will enable smart contracts on Push Chain to access the state of both EVM and non-EVM wallets connected to a single user.</p>
<p>The result is <strong>universal applications</strong> for web3. In this paradigm, instead of being a user of "Uniswap on Ethereum," "Uniswap on Polygon," or "Uniswap on Arbitrum," a person simply becomes a <strong>user of Uniswap</strong>.</p>
<p>These innovations make Push Chain suitable for creating new experiences or cross-deploying existing consumer-centric apps tied to specific blockchains, making them accessible to any web3 user.</p>

<p>Push Chain addresses specific gaps in the existing blockchains, such as interoperability, shared app experiences, enabling new app experiences, and scalability. While existing blockchains are robust, they operate in their own eco-system and an aggregator to unite these chains are needed.</p>
<p>Push Chain‚Äôs focus is on being a <strong>shared state chain</strong> for universal applications acting as a unifying layer where all chains can come together and use PC as universal hub or do settlement between them.</p>
<p>PC offers a new paradigm of web3 that works from <strong>any chain.</strong> for <strong>any user.</strong> and is suitable for <strong>any app.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Any Chain Txs and Blockchain Agnostic Wallet Addresses</strong></p>
<p>As a shared-state blockchain, Push Chain adopts <strong>CAIP-10 standards</strong> (shoutout to <a href="https://x.com/pedrouid" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Follow Pedrouid on X">@pedrouid</a>, allowing it to parse the chain, network, and address of each transaction. This ensures true interoperability across multiple blockchain ecosystems.</p>
<p><strong>Consumer Txs (unordered) and Traditional Txs (ordered)</strong></p>
<p>Push introduces a new type of transaction that we define as <strong>consumer transactions</strong>.</p>
<p>When you look at consumer apps of web2, you quickly notice that they are made of two components:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Transactions where order is necessary</strong> (e.g., user payments, financial instruments).</li>
<li><strong>Transactions where order is not critical</strong> (e.g., messages, comments or likes on a post, retweets, chats, emails, gameplay, etc.).</li>
</ol>
<p>These unordered actions dominate consumer apps, but traditional chains don‚Äôt provide the right experience for them.</p>
<p>Push Chain introduces <strong>unordered transactions</strong>, where order is not critical. These transactions can be sent to any of the validators running on the network to be processed.</p>
<p>This innovation will have a significant impact on web3, enabling consumer apps that combine financial, mixed-financial, and non-financial transactions with the same scalability and speed seen in web2.</p>
<p><strong>Parallel Validators &amp; Dynamic Sharding</strong></p>
<p>Push Chain uses a <strong>node governor smart contract</strong>, which registers all the different types of nodes. This governor contract not only registers nodes but also keeps track of the number of validator, storage, and archival nodes.</p>
<ul>
<li>It adjusts the replication factor.</li>
<li>Assigns address chunks to shards.</li>
<li>Enables parallel validators to process transactions, allowing the chain to scale linearly with the number of nodes added to the network.</li>
</ul>
<p>This approach achieves <strong>true scale</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Wallet and Fee Abstraction</strong></p>
<p><strong>Wallet abstraction</strong> provides a flexible, embeddable wallet experience, tailored to individual user journeys while preserving decentralization. This abstraction simplifies the user experience (UX) for both existing and new web3 users.</p>
<p><strong>For Existing Web3 Users</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you're already using Ethereum, Solana, or another chain, the <strong>Push Chain wallet</strong> allows you to continue using your current setup‚Äîno extra hoops.</li>
<li>Combined with <strong>fee abstraction</strong>, transactions stay native to the source blockchain, making cross-chain use effortless.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For New Web3 Users (Web2 Normies)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Not web3-savvy? No problem. Just log in with an email or social account.</li>
<li>Under the hood, the wallet uses sharding and passkeys to stay non-custodial but feels as simple and intuitive as web2.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Shared State and Universal Smart Contracts</strong></p>
<p>With <strong>Push ID</strong>, the state of a non-Push wallet and multiple wallets across any chain is mapped to a single user. This ensures that the user's state across all blockchains is known.</p>
<p>Combining this capability with <strong>universal smart contracts</strong> unlocks innovations that web3 hasn‚Äôt seen before, enabling the era of universal apps.</p>

<p>Phase 1 lays the groundwork of building universal consumer apps focusing on introducing a scalable, chain agnostic, and unified layer capable of handling any types of consumer apps including financial but also non-financial and mixed-financial apps. The features in this phase include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enabling true scale apps</li>
<li>Allowing transactions from any chain</li>
<li>Introducing Consumer transactions (where ordering is not important)</li>
<li>Push VM for complex on-chain applications</li>
<li>Fee abstraction</li>
<li>Wallet abstraction</li>
<li>Push ID to map multiple EVM and non-EVM wallet to a single identity</li>
<li>Enabling PoS (Proof of Stake) with dynamic sharding and parallel validators</li>
</ul>
<p>Phase 2 centers on facilitating seamless interoperability between chains which is a stepping stone in enabling universal smart contracts to usher in universal apps.
This phase introduces a solver network capable of instant cross-chain transactions, both financial and non-financial based. The non-financial distinction is crucial as it enables all payloads to move instantly between Push-connected chains, benefiting consumer applications like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Social media</li>
<li>Marketplaces</li>
<li>Gaming</li>
<li>Other consumer-facing use cases</li>
</ul>
<p>Phase 3 is about introducing shared state and the launch of universal smart contracts, enabling true shared state and universal apps.</p>

<p>Push Chain addresses pervasive gaps in the existing blockchains; specifically interoperability, shared app experiences, and scalability. While existing blockchains are robust, they operate in silos and lack the ability to unify state across multiple blockchains. Push Chain‚Äôs focus is on being a <strong>shared state chain for universal applications</strong>, offering seamless cross-chain interactions and unparalleled scalability.</p>

<p>The term shared state means that Push Chain not only has read and write access to its own state but also has read-only access to all the other supported chains‚Äô states. This is the final and most imperative phase of Push Chain, and it enables <strong>universal apps</strong> that seamlessly function across multiple chains.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Push Chain Universal App" src="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-943/assets/images/pcuniversalapp-b1592bc5a870b8a52a544d01c1702efe.webp" title="Push Chain - Shared State Chain for Universal Apps" width="1600" height="1213" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Push Chain achieves shared state by leveraging Push ID, which maps multiple EVM and non-EVM wallets to a single identity. This allows for a single user to have a single state across all chains, enabling true shared state.</p>
<p>The whole vision of universal apps with shared states is achieved through 4 core features:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Fee and Wallet Abstraction:</strong>
With wallet abstraction, Push Chain aims to enable seamless user onboarding without going through the manual and complicated procedure of setting up a web3 wallet.
With fee abstraction, the chain eliminates the friction of requiring to hold native gas strictly in the wallet in use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Seamless Interoperability:</strong>
With Phase 2 of its roadmap, the chain aims to establish seamless interoperability between chains to enable cross-chain features in the apps.</p>
<p>The interoperability will be enabled using a solver network capable of instant cross-chain transactions to ensure better UX. The network will be designed to move not only value but also arbitrary payloads that seamlessly transfer smart contract calls to other chains.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Any Chain Transaction:</strong>
With fee abstraction layer and interoperability, the chain is then able to provide the capability for users and apps on this chain to seamlessly initiate transactions for any chain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Unified VM:</strong>
A unified VM that enables complex universal smart contract logic that is able to execute cross chain actions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Combining these 4 main pillars, the chain aims to achieve shared app experiences and unlock a plethora of new cross-chain and universal app use cases in every domain of web3.</p>

<p>As a new layer 1, Push Chain would have its own native token with tokenomics suited to the functioning, maintenance, and security of a blockchain.</p>
<p>The governance proposal for Push Chain introduces the layer 1 as a potential direction for the Push ecosystem. If approved, Push would then introduce tokenomics for feedback and discussion among the community.</p>
<p>Push Chain would need a new token because an L1 token has a fundamentally different design and purpose than a token designed to incentivize the notifications protocol. A priority for Push Chain tokenomics is to ensure that all Push Protocol $PUSH holders are able to migrate their tokens to the Push Chain native token (ticker TBD).</p>
<p><strong>Note: Push Chain mainnet is not live, nor is any token related to Push Chain besides Push Protocol <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/epns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="$PUSH on CMC">$PUSH</a>.</strong> Any communication about Push Chain will come directly from the Push company website and X / Twitter handle.</p>

<p>Push Chain is a natural evolution of Push Protocol's vision. Current services of Push Protocol remain a priority, ensuring they continue to improve while benefiting from the new infrastructure.</p>
<p>Today's push notification and chat protocols will benefit significantly from being built on top of Push Chain. A dedicated section of the team will focus on maintaining and enhancing these protocols, ensuring they remain the de-facto standard in their respective domains.</p>
<p>By aligning with Push Chain, notifications and chat sent through the protocols will be processed as transactions on the chain. This integration not only enables these protocols to accrue value but also marks the beginning of a new chapter in their evolution, further enhancing their utility and impact within the web3 ecosystem.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Validator Nodes:</strong> Responsible for handling transaction validation and serving as the primary interface for client interactions.</li>
<li><strong>Storage Nodes:</strong> Tasked with storing validated transactions in a sharded manner for optimized data access and storage efficiency.</li>
<li><strong>Archival Nodes:</strong> Maintain a comprehensive record of all network transactions, enabling historical data access and providing support for applications like blockchain explorers.</li>

<p>The benchmarking tests were conducted in controlled environments with different node configurations:</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="environment-configurations">Environment Configurations<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-943/blog/parallel-validators-and-dynamic-sharding#environment-configurations" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Environment Configurations" title="Direct link to Environment Configurations">‚Äã</a></h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Configuration 1</strong>:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li><strong>5 Validator Nodes</strong>, <strong>8 Storage Nodes</strong>, <strong>5 Archival Nodes</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>2 CPU cores</strong> allocated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Configuration 2</strong>:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li><strong>10 Validator Nodes</strong>, <strong>8 Storage Nodes</strong>, <strong>5 Archival Nodes</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>20 Validator Nodes</strong>, <strong>8 Storage Nodes</strong>, <strong>5 Archival Nodes</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>8 CPU cores</strong> allocated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The benchmarks primarily evaluate the performance of the <strong>validator nodes</strong>, which serve as the gateway for client interactions. However, since validator nodes interact with storage nodes and archival nodes internally, the results effectively reflect the performance of the entire network.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ö° <strong>Note on</strong> <strong>Controlled Environment:</strong> All of these benchmarks were performed in a controlled internal network environment. As a result, any network lags or latency typically observed in real-world public networks were kept to a minimum, ensuring that the results reflect the network‚Äôs inherent capabilities rather than external factors. This setup allows for more accurate measurement of the Push Chain Network‚Äôs performance under varying configurations without the interference of significant network delays.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>üìä <strong>Note on CPU Scaling:</strong> In order to simulate a decentralized network more realistically, the number of CPU cores allocated scales proportionally with the number of nodes. For instance, 2 CPU cores are allocated for 5 validator nodes, 4 CPU cores for 10 nodes, and 8 CPU cores for 20 nodes. This approach mirrors how resources would likely be distributed in a decentralized system, where each node operator contributes computational resources to the network.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>‚öôÔ∏è <strong>Note on Node Configuration:</strong> For simplicity and consistency, the number of <strong>Storage Nodes</strong> and <strong>Archival Nodes</strong> is kept constant at <strong>8</strong> and <strong>5</strong>, respectively, across all configurations. This ensures that the focus remains on evaluating the performance of the <strong>Validator Nodes</strong> and their interactions with the network, without introducing additional variables.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Scalability:</strong> As the number of nodes increased, the Push Chain Network demonstrated significantly improved scalability, particularly in <strong>Configuration 3</strong>. This configuration exhibited the best performance across most tests, showcasing the network‚Äôs ability to scale efficiently without sacrificing speed. The benefits of <strong>dynamic sharding</strong> ensured that even as the network grew, the system maintained fast response times, handling multiple concurrent threads effectively.</li>
<li><strong>Performance Bottlenecks:</strong> While performance remained strong as the node count grew, the network did experience timeouts and errors at higher thread counts. This indicates that, although the system can scale, there are throughput limits at extreme loads. However, <strong>Configuration 3</strong> was able to handle a larger volume of requests compared to smaller configurations, validating the advantages of scaling up the number of validator nodes. Given that the <strong>goal of the Push Chain Network</strong> is to scale up to <strong>100,000 validator nodes</strong>, the throughput limits observed at high thread counts are just the beginning. As the network grows, these limits would become significantly larger, making the network capable of handling a vastly higher volume of requests.</li>
<li><strong>Real-World Application:</strong> The results illustrate how the Push Chain Network becomes more scalable as nodes are added, making it a robust solution for future consumer-centric applications where network demands will increase.</li>
</ul>
<p>These benchmarks offer valuable insights into the scaling behaviour of the Push Chain Network, demonstrating its readiness to support growing adoption and demanding workloads. Moving forward, continued optimizations in areas like transaction propagation, parallel processing, and sharding will further enhance the network‚Äôs performance, enabling it to handle even higher loads.</p>

<p>One of the defining aspects of decentralized networks is their lack of a central authority to govern how they operate. Instead, these networks rely on a set of rules and systems to securely communicate and reach consensus on the overall state of the network.</p>
<p>Achieving this is no small task. It involves many essential components that ensure the network remains secure and fair, and among the most critical of these is <strong>randomness</strong>.</p>
<p>At its core, randomness is the absence of patterns or predictability in events. It's what makes a dice roll uncertain, ensures fairness in games, and strengthens the cryptographic algorithms that secure modern systems. In decentralized networks, randomness serves as a cornerstone of security and fairness, helping to prevent bias and manipulation.</p>
<p>In this article, we delve into the importance of randomness in decentralized networks and explore how Push Nodes use randomness to bolster the security of the Push Chain.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="why-do-we-need-randomness">Why do we need Randomness?<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-943/blog/randomized-node-selection-push-chain#why-do-we-need-randomness" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why do we need Randomness?" title="Direct link to Why do we need Randomness?">‚Äã</a></h2>
<p>To begin with, let‚Äôs explore why randomness is so important in decentralized networks.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, decentralized networks lack a central authority. Instead, they rely on a distributed group of nodes spread across the globe. These nodes are responsible for performing various actions to ensure the network remains operational.</p>
<p>For the network to stay secure and fair, the selection of nodes for specific tasks must happen in a decentralized and unbiased manner. This is where <strong>randomness</strong> becomes crucial.</p>
<p>In decentralized systems, randomness ensures unpredictability in key processes, such as selecting validators or generating cryptographic keys. This unpredictability is vital to prevent malicious actors from manipulating the system or gaining undue control. For example, in consensus mechanisms like Proof of Stake, the random selection of validators ensures that no single participant can dominate the process, preserving the network's decentralized nature.</p>
<p>Randomness also strengthens the resilience of blockchains by making it harder for attackers to predict or influence outcomes. This unpredictability guards against attacks like <strong>Sybil attacks</strong> (where adversaries create fake identities) or <strong>collusion</strong> (where groups conspire to take control of the network).</p>
<p>Additionally, randomness plays a key role in promoting fairness. It ensures that every participant in the network has an equal chance to contribute and benefit, regardless of their resources or influence.</p>
<p>With this understanding of how crucial randomness is, let‚Äôs explore how Push Nodes leverage randomness to enhance the security and fairness of the Push Chain.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="a-glance-at-push-nodes">A Glance at Push Nodes<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-943/blog/randomized-node-selection-push-chain#a-glance-at-push-nodes" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to A Glance at Push Nodes" title="Direct link to A Glance at Push Nodes">‚Äã</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://push.org/blog/explaining-push-nodes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Push Nodes</a>&nbsp;are a significant step towards the decentralized infrastructure for web3‚Äôs leading communication layer, Push Network. This network is designed to facilitate secure and efficient movement of web3 notifications.</p>
<p>The Push Chain comprises different types of nodes such as Validator Nodes, Storage Nodes, and Archival Nodes. A smart contract guards the network to maintain node staking and slashing. This is where the PUSH token is used.</p>

<p>In this section, we will specifically understand the complete mechanism of how a transaction is submitted onto Push Chain and the role of randomness involved in the process.</p>
<p>In the Push Chain, the role of randomization is incorporated at multiple levels which allows the network to prevent centralization while ensuring that it remains resilient against a variety of attacks.</p>
<p>A crucial security mechanism of the Push Chain is the randomized selection of validators for transaction validation or block production. This mechanism leverages cryptographic randomness to ensure an unpredictable selection of validators &amp;&nbsp;attestants (who verify whether or not a transaction is legit) to enhance the network‚Äôs resilience and fairness.</p>
<p><strong>A brief overview of the process looks something like this:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To send a transaction to the network, the SDK/sender must attach a randomly generated token number to the transaction.</li>
<li>To fetch this token, the SDK can request the same from any validator.</li>

<p>The Push SDK selects a random validator (VR1) to generate a special signed (RANDX) hex token.</p>
<p>The generation is performed as follows:</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="1-generation-of-a-random-token">1. <strong>Generation of a Random Token:</strong><a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-943/blog/randomized-node-selection-push-chain#1-generation-of-a-random-token" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1-generation-of-a-random-token" title="Direct link to 1-generation-of-a-random-token">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>The network is designed to ensure that a random token cannot merely be generated by a single validator. Instead, it must be a combined effort as every random token is ideally a collection of digitally signed pieces of random numbers provided by specific validators in the network.</p>
<p>To determine the exact number of such pieces required to form the token, the Validator.sol smart contract defines a parameter called&nbsp;<code>required_random_number</code>. This indicates the number of required random peers whose signed values each validator must hold, at a given time. Additionally, the contract also defines an&nbsp;<code>expiration_time</code>&nbsp;parameter that defines the expiry time for these tokens which helps ensure that only freshly created tokens can be used for the creation of random tokens.</p>
<p>It should be kept in mind that validators in the network periodically ping their peers to collect and exchange signed random values. The collected value from each validator is a combination of the random value itself and the validator's signature, ensuring it can be verifiable.</p>

<p>As a result, at any given moment the validators should have a collection of signed random values by their peers, i.e.,&nbsp;<strong><code>signedRandomValue[].</code></strong></p>
<p>Once a validator has accumulated the necessary signed random values, it can generate the random token. This token is derived from the network's collective randomness using the following formula:</p>

<p>Next, now let‚Äôs understand what happens when the SDK requests for a random token.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, before sending any transaction to the network, the SDK&nbsp;requests for a random token that must be attached with the transaction being sent.</p>
<p>Now, since a random token value has already been generated (as mentioned in step 1), any validator can provide this random token to the SDK.</p>
<p>The SDK then attaches this random token to the transaction payloads and sends the transaction to the network.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="3-randomized-selection-of-validators">3. <strong>Randomized Selection of Validators</strong><a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-943/blog/randomized-node-selection-push-chain#3-randomized-selection-of-validators" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 3-randomized-selection-of-validators" title="Direct link to 3-randomized-selection-of-validators">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>This random token attached to the transaction plays a crucial role in randomly deciding which validator will process the transaction. With this token, the SDK deciphers the validator ID, to whom it must send the transaction for further processing.</p>

<p>Upon receiving the transaction, the validator checks the random token in the transaction‚Äôs payload and validates it to confirm that it has been correctly assigned the role of handling this transaction.</p>
<p>In case the validator identifies that it has been wrongly chosen,&nbsp;<strong><em>it can reject the transaction.</em></strong></p>
<p>Once the accurate assignment of the validator is confirmed, the validator now creates a similar randomized process for creating a list of validators who must attest to the transaction being processed.</p>

<p>To summarize, the entire process detailed above adds a security layer with the inclusion of randomization at multiple levels, i.e.:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1st Level:</strong>&nbsp;The initial randomization starts with the SDK choosing any random validator to request for a token to be attached to the transaction.</li>
<li><strong>2nd Level: A token is generated</strong>&nbsp;using digitally signed pieces of random values from multiple random validators instead of relying on any single actor.</li>
<li><strong>3rd Level: A specific validator is randomly selected</strong>&nbsp;to create the token to be attached before the transaction occurs.</li>
<li><strong>4th Level:</strong>&nbsp;The final level of randomization determines which specific validator (VR2) will process a transaction and which validator set will act as attestants to verify the transaction.</li>
</ul>
<p>This multi-level randomness ensures that at every step, the network is secure, and fair, while continuing to operate in a completely decentralized fashion.</p>

<p>In a globally distributed computing environment, achieving collective agreement on the true state of the system has always been a complex challenge.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are algorithms (<em>specialized instructions</em>) that assist in preserving this ‚Äòsingle-truth-state‚Äô while balancing network security, long-term sustainability, and economic incentives.</p>
<p>Such algorithms in the web3 space, are popularly known as Consensus Algorithms.</p>
<p>This article is the only guide you will need to know about - What Proof of Stake is, its significance and how does it work.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="proof-of-stake---a-quick-overview">Proof of Stake - A quick overview:<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-943/blog/understand-proof-of-stake-and-push-chain#proof-of-stake---a-quick-overview" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Proof of Stake - A quick overview:" title="Direct link to Proof of Stake - A quick overview:">‚Äã</a></h2>
<p>Proof of Stake is a consensus algorithm used to secure blockchain networks where block producers (validators) are chosen based on the number of tokens they're willing to "stake" or lock up as collateral.</p>
<p>Validators are incentivised to act honestly, since, any malicious behaviour would result in them losing their staked assets.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="First Image of Understand Proof of Stake (POS) and Push Chain PoS" src="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-943/assets/images/image1-e1c9d431f7518c55fbfe2c3aa7dea283.webp" width="2396" height="824" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Validators are nodes responsible for securing the network by performing two key actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proposing new blocks - containing transactions.</li>
<li>Attestation - Examining and voting on the blocks proposed by other validators</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that we have a basic understanding about the PoS, lets go down the rabbit hole to know more about it.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="why-do-we-need-pos">Why do we need PoS?<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-943/blog/understand-proof-of-stake-and-push-chain#why-do-we-need-pos" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why do we need PoS?" title="Direct link to Why do we need PoS?">‚Äã</a></h2>
<p>Each network is based on some foundational philosophies.</p>
<p>Bitcoin popularly known for its PoW (Proof of Work) algorithm is based on the principal of earning the right to validate by demonstrating computational work.</p>
<p>Chains like Ethereum, Solana and Push Chain are predominantly based on the philosophies of ‚ÄúProving value to validate and earn incentives at the risk of commitment and economic loss‚Äù</p>
<p>This proves your commitment towards the network by staking tokens to participate in network‚Äôs consensus with the risk of being penalized for jeopardizing the network‚Äôs security.</p>

<p>Staking makes it easier for individuals to participate in securing the network, promoting decentralization.</p>
<p>An Ethereum validator node could be easily run on a normal laptop.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>PoS networks are highly energy efficient in terms of cost of operations and compute consumption.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PoS eliminates the energy-intensive mining computations of PoW, replacing them with a stake-based validator selection process that requires only basic network communication and transaction validation operations.</p>

<p>In PoS networks, influence is tied to economical commitment instead of computational power.</p>
<p>Participants (validators) pledge their assets (stake) in exchange for the right to participate in the network‚Äôs consensus.</p>
<p>Thus, creating a relationship that equally benefits the interests of the validators as well as the collective network.</p>
<p><em>The equation only stands true until the validators stay true to their commitments.</em></p>

<p>The success of a PoS network hinges on the honesty of its validators.</p>
<p>Validators are required to deposit (stake) the networks native currency in adequate quantities to participate in the block creation.</p>
<p>Validators risk losing their staked assets <em>(getting slashed</em> *) if they attempt to game the system for their personal gains by :</p>
<ul>
<li>Approving fraudulent transactions</li>
<li>Censoring incoming transactions.</li>
<li>Failing to participate</li>
<li>Sending conflicting attestations</li>
<li>Proposing multiple blocks in a single slot (aka Equivocating)</li>
</ul>
<p>As the network grows, the cost to attack it increases proportionally.</p>
<p>The amount of tokens slashed varies with every network.</p>

<p>In PoS the block creation is a process of ‚Äú<strong>probabilistic election</strong>‚Äù rather than ‚Äú<strong>computation competition</strong>‚Äù.</p>
<p>Since time taken to elect a validator is significantly less, block creation frequency is (arguably) much higher than PoW networks, significantly boosting transaction speeds and scalability.</p>

<p>As highlighted earlier, in a PoS network, the cost to attack increases proportionally with the network‚Äôs growth.</p>
<p>A 51% attack‚Äîwhere malicious actors gain control of 51% of staked coins to reverse transactions and manipulate block confirmations becomes increasingly impractical and expensive as the network grows and the token prices rises (ideally).</p>

<p>PoW chains like Bitcoin does not have an Exit Penalty mechanism to punish the validators for deterring the integrity of network. But PoS chains, like Push Chain cover all the bases, ensuring stricter sybil resistance.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="how-does-proof-of-stake-work">How does Proof of Stake work?<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-943/blog/understand-proof-of-stake-and-push-chain#how-does-proof-of-stake-work" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How does Proof of Stake work?" title="Direct link to How does Proof of Stake work?">‚Äã</a></h2>
<p>The Proof of Stake (PoS) process operates in three key phases:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Validator Selection</strong></li>
<li><strong>Block Creation and Validation</strong></li>
<li><strong>Finalization</strong></li>
</ol>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="validator-selection"><strong>Validator Selection:</strong><a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-943/blog/understand-proof-of-stake-and-push-chain#validator-selection" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to validator-selection" title="Direct link to validator-selection">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Fifth Image of Understand Proof of Stake (POS) and Push Chain PoS" src="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-943/assets/images/image5-d24488a5c3075314c38e3ecbbcaaa89f.webp" width="2180" height="506" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Validator Selection forms the backbone of PoS, where nodes participate by staking the network‚Äôs native currency into a deposit contract. The staked amount must meet or exceed a predetermined threshold or lowerbound (e.g., 32 ETH for Ethereum).</p>
<p>To propose a block, the probability of validators getting elected is directly proportional to the staked amount relative to the total coins staked across the network.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="block-creation"><strong>Block creation:</strong><a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-943/blog/understand-proof-of-stake-and-push-chain#block-creation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to block-creation" title="Direct link to block-creation">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>Timekeeping is critical in PoS, structured through two key units: <strong>Slot</strong> and <strong>Epoch.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A slot - is a fixed duration of time that varies network to network (1 slot = 12 sec in Ethereum and 400ms in Solana).</li>
<li><strong>Epoch</strong>: A cycle comprising multiple slots (e.g., 32 slots in Ethereum)</li>
</ul>
<p>Slots are sequential and occur one after other in a linear manner.</p>
<p>(<em>But not in case of Push Chain - More on this later</em>)</p>
<p>Each slot is assigned to a randomly chosen validator, selected through specialized algorithms like RANDAO in Ethereum and VDF - Verifiable Delay Function in Solana.</p>
<p>Within their slot duration, validators are responsible for tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Package transactions into a block</li>
<li>Verify their validity</li>
<li>Initiate the process of propagating the block across the network.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once a block is proposed, a committee of a defined number of validators is randomly chosen to vote on the validity of the block by careful examining of its contents - This process is called as attestation.</p>
<p><strong>Attestation Weight</strong>: Each vote is weighted based on the validator‚Äôs stake.</p>
<p><strong>Confirmation</strong>: A block is finalized when at least 2/3 of the total staked tokens sign off on its validity, ensuring a strong consensus.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Missed Blocks</strong> - Instances when a validator fails to propose a block within their slot, it results in a missed block.</li>
<li><strong>Orphaned Blocks</strong> - These occur when a block is rejected by the validating committee or during a chain fork. Orphaned blocks represent alternative versions of chain history that are not followed by majority of network.</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, this is how the entire process would look like:</p>

<p>Push Chain - is a Proof of Stake shared state blockchain for shared app experiences designed to support the development of <strong>hyper-scalable, consumer-centric, universal web3 applications.</strong></p>
<p>Push Chain enables txs from any chain (Solana, Eth, EVM, or non-EVM) with fast finality of &lt; 1 second. It has the ability to scale infinitely as nodes increase, supporting tens of thousands of parallel transactions</p>
<ul>
<li>Any Chain Tx ‚õìÔ∏è</li>
<li>Fee &amp; Wallet Abstraction üí∞&nbsp;üîê</li>
<li>Parallel Validation and Dynamic Sharding üõ†Ô∏è</li>
<li>Consumer tx (unordered) and Traditional tx (ordered)</li>
<li>Universal Smart Contract üåê</li>
<li>Shared App Experience ü§ù</li>
</ul>
<p>Push Chain uses an innovative approach towards tweaking its consensus mechanism in order to incorporate its multi-node architecture and ability to support both, ordered and un-ordered blocks with parallel validation.</p>
<p>Push Chain distributes responsibilities across three specialized node types:</p>
<p><strong>Validator Nodes</strong> - Forms the backbone of the network, handling transaction validation and block production.</p>
<p><strong>Storage Nodes</strong> - Manage the network's data through dynamic sharding, enabling efficient distribution and retrieval. Storage Nodes work in sync with validators to ensure data availability and decentralization.</p>
<p><strong>Archival Nodes</strong> - Serve as the network's historical record keepers, storing complete transaction logs and providing WebSocket functionality for real-time data access and analytics.</p>
<p>Optimised for hyper scalable consumer apps - Push Chain introduces <strong>stateless blocks</strong> with parallel execution for faster processing and validation of non-value consumer data transactions.</p>
<p>For selecting block validators - the system uses a multi-level randomization process to avoid validator collusion during parallel block processing.</p>
<p>More details about the randomization mechanism can be found in the <a href="https://whitepaper.push.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Push Chain Whitepaper</a>.</p>
<p>To maintain the network‚Äôs economical integrity Push Chain has a modified penalising mechanism which includes the act of ‚ÄòReporting‚Äô. It acts like a warning to correct the node‚Äôs behaviour instead of simply slashing and banning the node instantly.</p>

<p>Push Protocol recently announced its <a href="https://gov.push.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">governance proposal</a> of launching Push Chain.</p>
<p>Push Protocol envisions the creation of Push Chain which enables a shared state L1 chain designed to support truly scalable consumer applications and universal applications.</p>
<p>This article explains why Push Chain is needed and why it matters.</p>
<p>We will dive deep into each of the concerns that exist in web3 today and the solutions that Push Chain offers for each one of them.</p>
<p>In order to understand what Push Chain offers, let‚Äôs first get a good understanding of the concerns in today‚Äôs web3 world that is a blocker for consumer apps and universal/unified applications.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="the-major-concerns-in-web3-today">The Major Concerns in Web3 Today<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-943/blog/why-push-chain#the-major-concerns-in-web3-today" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Major Concerns in Web3 Today" title="Direct link to The Major Concerns in Web3 Today">‚Äã</a></h2>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="web3-is-not-well-equipped-for-building-truly-scalable-consumer-centric-adoption">Web3 is not well-equipped for building truly scalable consumer-centric adoption<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-943/blog/why-push-chain#web3-is-not-well-equipped-for-building-truly-scalable-consumer-centric-adoption" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Web3 is not well-equipped for building truly scalable consumer-centric adoption" title="Direct link to Web3 is not well-equipped for building truly scalable consumer-centric adoption">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>Fundamentally, web3 should be unbiased towards a peculiar industry use case. However, practically, there‚Äôs an evident misalignment where today‚Äôs web3 infrastructure is more optimized for financial use cases.</p>
<p>Financial apps and consumer-centric apps (<em>e.g. social, gaming, etc</em>) inherently have different infrastructure needs:</p>
<p>Finance-specific apps require:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>A high level of security,</em></li>
<li><em>Strict transaction and block ordering,</em></li>
<li><em>Prioritization of state accuracy and finality over speed, etc.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>On the flip side consumer apps require more flexible models that emphasize:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Hyper scalability</em></li>
<li><em>Low latency</em></li>
<li><em>Simplified UX</em></li>
<li><em>Affordability</em></li>
<li><em>Support for both ordered and unordered transactions ( a.k.a, consumer transactions, as we call it )</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Web3 ecosystem is heavily skewed towards financial applications. The bias is evident in the rise of projects centered around trading, lending, staking, perps, and similar use cases.</p>
<p>Such finance-centric infrastructure forces consumer apps to make suboptimal compromises impacting their performance and usability.</p>
<p>Even the advent of app-specific chains hasn‚Äôt fully resolved these tradeoffs.</p>
<p>For instance, the <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/state-of-crypto-report-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>State of Crypto 2024</strong></a> report by a16z highlights how on-chain games running on dedicated rollups are struggling to keep up with the increasing user demand, straining the network and as a result consuming multifolds of M/gas (<em>mega gas per second</em>) as compared to Ethereum.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="First Image of Why Push Chain" src="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-943/assets/images/image1-eb0b7729b82e747edaacd4830a051f72.webp" width="1536" height="864" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Consumer-centric apps, which could appeal to broader audiences, are still in their infancy compared to the much more mature and sophisticated DeFi sector.</p>
<p>This focus on finance has led to a situation where the average user might view web3 as a playground for traders and investors rather than a tool for everyday life.</p>
<p>The report from a16z also provides another key insight:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Second Image of Why Push Chain" src="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-943/assets/images/image2-c5b67901ce12b97c3fbf39b8cd9a5f02.webp" width="1868" height="1558" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p><strong>Out of ~617 million global crypto users, only 5-10% (30-60 million) users actively transact!</strong></p>
<p>Barriers to entry, the dilemma of choosing the right chain, and multiple points of friction in UX could reasonably be attributed as causes of the growing share of dormant users.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Third Image of Why Push Chain" src="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-943/assets/images/image3-2751b46496c5642278c8ebdb04b5df65.webp" width="2408" height="1000" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Vitalik in his <a href="https://youtu.be/ei3tDRMjw6k?si=w1kYuzgR0ho-90Eb&amp;t=1775" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent talk at Devcon</a> (timestamp: 29:35) emphasized the need for building both non-financial and mixed financial applications.</p>

<p>With Vitalik‚Äôs conception of the <em>Rollup-Centric Roadmap, back in 2020,</em> Ethereum pivoted towards rollups as their scaling strategy - as <strong>bundling multiple transactions</strong>&nbsp;<strong>into batches</strong>&nbsp;significantly increased&nbsp;<strong><em>transaction throughput</em></strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong><em>reduced transaction costs.</em></strong></p>
<p>This solved Ethereum‚Äôs scalability issues effectively and led to an abundance of <em>L2 and L3 chains.</em></p>
<p>However, the joyous ride is now hitting some rough bumps.</p>

<p><em>Clutter is the Enemy of Clarity.</em></p>
<p>With each additional step spent completing an action, including switching between networks, time spent in choosing the right chain, protocol, or wallet, decreases <a href="https://andrewchen.com/psychd-funnel-conversion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Psych</em> - a unit of measure for motivation to complete an action.</a></p>
<p>Here is a quick glance at what a typical web3 user needs to deal with in this multi-chain universe:</p>
<ul>
<li>Managing multiple wallets,</li>
<li>Managing multiple native tokens/assets in their multiple wallets,</li>
<li>Understanding the nuances of each network,</li>
<li>Navigating multiple networks to perform simple tasks,</li>
<li>Interacting with complicated dapp UIs with frequent network switching</li>
<li>Navigate through inconsistent user interfaces</li>
<li>Relying on the risky route of cross-chain bridging between chains</li>
<li>Experiencing difficulty in maintaining a consistent cross-chain identity due to the multi-chain ecosystem</li>
<li>Dealing with the lack of standardization between networks, protocols, etc</li>
<li>Dealing with the learning curve of understanding different networks, each with its own set of rules, interfaces, and requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember that this is just a glance at the UX problem.</p>
<p>There are undoubtedly more issues for a web3 user daily. The list is even longer when it comes to newbie web3 users.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Fourth Image of Why Push Chain" src="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-943/assets/images/image4-1ffdae2ec53d35c95e7f47f4c1f0acbe.webp" width="2128" height="1140" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="user-retention-challenges">User Retention Challenges<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-943/blog/why-push-chain#user-retention-challenges" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to User Retention Challenges" title="Direct link to User Retention Challenges">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>Poor UX can directly impact user retention.</p>
<p>Truth be told, it already is impacting user retention.</p>
<p>When users encounter difficulties in navigating the web3 ecosystem, they are less likely to return to it. High-profile dApps that have struggled with user retention due to UX issues serve as cautionary tales for new projects entering the space. Complex interfaces, slow transaction times, and confusing wallet setups have all contributed to a decline in user engagement and adoption.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="security-and-trust-concerns"><strong>Security and Trust Concerns</strong><a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-943/blog/why-push-chain#security-and-trust-concerns" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to security-and-trust-concerns" title="Direct link to security-and-trust-concerns">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>The complexity of managing multiple chains also introduces security risks.</p>
<p>Users must ensure that they are interacting with the correct chain, using the right wallet, and understanding the implications of each transaction. This complexity increases the likelihood of user errors, such as sending assets to the wrong address or falling victim to phishing attacks.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the process of bridging assets between these chains is quite often cumbersome and fraught with risks. Users must rely on various bridging protocols, which not only add to the complexity but also introduce potential security vulnerabilities. For instance, a user willing to move tokens from Ethereum to an L2 solution must navigate multiple steps, including wrapping and unwrapping tokens, which can be a deterrent for new users.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="increased-complexity-for-builders"><strong>Increased Complexity for Builders:</strong><a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-943/blog/why-push-chain#increased-complexity-for-builders" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to increased-complexity-for-builders" title="Direct link to increased-complexity-for-builders">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>Each chain often has its own development tools, SDKs, and environments that developers must learn &amp; adapt to, which can be time-consuming and lead to inconsistencies in development practices. Maintaining applications that operate across multiple chains requires managing multiple codebases or conditional code paths. This can lead to significant maintenance overhead, especially when chains update their protocols or APIs.</p>
<p>Each additional chain integrated into an application introduces new potential vulnerabilities. Developers must ensure that the security of cross-chain interactions is robust, as any weakness could lead to exploits or hacks.</p>
<p>Furthermore, developing for a multi-chain ecosystem that still lacks adequate standardization - is costly. It requires more time and resources, as developers need to learn and implement different protocols, test on multiple platforms, and ensure compatibility across the whole environment involved. The additional cost of extensive security audits makes the process of building &amp; maintaining apps even more difficult.</p>
<p>There is no one size fits all solution, nor is there a way to restrict the proliferation of chains.</p>
<p><strong><em>But what if there was a way to unify every fragmented state under one shared state?</em></strong></p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="a-shared-state-chain-is-needed-that-can-enable-shared-app-experiences"><strong>A shared state chain is needed that can enable shared app experiences</strong><a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-943/blog/why-push-chain#a-shared-state-chain-is-needed-that-can-enable-shared-app-experiences" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to a-shared-state-chain-is-needed-that-can-enable-shared-app-experiences" title="Direct link to a-shared-state-chain-is-needed-that-can-enable-shared-app-experiences">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>Let‚Äôs dive a bit further into the complexities of multi-chain web3 world.</p>
<p>While fragmented UX is definitely a concern, there are more.</p>
<p>There are over 30 Layer 1s, 120 Layer 2s and soon thousands of Layer 3 chains.
Imagine the sheer number of DApps deployed on all of these chains!</p>
<p>Newer chains have led to the rise of siloed environments having limited or zero awareness of each others state - even Ethereum!</p>
<p>The majority of these apps still operate within closed systems. Contracts pertaining to each chain store states in an isolated manner leaving little opportunity for users for a unified experience. Siloed environments in turn add more interop complexities forcing developers to <strong>shift price-sensitive apps</strong> to app-sensitive infrastructure, further affecting the UX and escalating fragmentation.</p>
<p>Here is a quick look at Vitalik and Justin Drake talking about the same issues:</p>

<p>With such an extent of liquidity, state and UX fragmentation, it becomes troublesome for web3 apps/users to seamlessly interact with apps on multiple chains. In fact, in order to move assets or payloads between chains, a user is often exposed to the on-chain intricacies and risks to achieve simple tasks.</p>
<p>For instance, a use with governance token on chain A cannot vote on any proposal of the same protocol on chain B as there is no unified system to support this activity. As a result, every app on a specific chain becomes its own siloed state.</p>
<p>This leads to an issue where there is no unified infra for apps to be built on. And there is a shared app experience for users to just use apps without having to worry about the underlying chains, finality risks, bridging or facing complicated UX.</p>
<p>So far, we have discussed the concerns.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs now understand what is Push Chain and how it helps us resolve these concerns.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="enter-push-chain">Enter Push Chain<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-943/blog/why-push-chain#enter-push-chain" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Enter Push Chain" title="Direct link to Enter Push Chain">‚Äã</a></h2>
<p>Push Chain is a shared state blockchain for shared app experience.</p>
<p>It is a Proof of Stake (PoS) chain built to allow developers to create scalable and universal apps and act as a shared settlement layer for multiple L1s, L2s and L3s. It is designed to allow transactions from any chain, use fee abstraction to avoid the strict requirement of native gas tokens for multiple chains and provide wallet abstraction for seamless onboarding and signing for any user.</p>
<p>It also introduces a new transaction type which we define as consumer transactions (where ordering is not important) to enable non-financial apps to have the speed and scalability which any consumer app requires. It leverages new mechanisms like parallel block execution and dynamic sharding to enable true scaling, and providing the perfect environment for any consumer app or universal app to thrive in the era of fragmented chains.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Seventh Image of Why Push Chain" src="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-943/assets/images/image7-a27f77c2896dc4553c78bb2717a94e90.webp" width="1034" height="920" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Push chain aims to solve some of the critical concerns in web3 today, as previously explained, and it plans to solve them in 3 specific phases. Each of these phases tackle a particular problem and eventually leads us to our core vision of achieving a shared app experience for web3 and enable universal apps with enhanced UX.</p>
<p>Mentioned below are the 3 main phases:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Phase-1:</strong> To enable consumer-centric apps with hyper scalability, fee abstraction, wallet abstraction and any chain transactions.</li>
<li><strong>Phase-2:</strong> To enable seamless interoperability between chains for apps and users.<br>
<!-- -->(<em>An intermediary phase to enable the universal smart contracts and shared state</em>)</li>
<li><strong>Phase-3:</strong> To enable universal smart contracts and shared state in order to make other chain‚Äôs state accessible on Push Chain and unlocking the era of universal apps.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, let‚Äôs understand each of the above-mentioned concerns and explore how Push Chain aims to resolve them.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>The Concerns with Consumer-Specific App</strong></p>
<p>So far we have explored why building and using consumer-specific web3 apps is difficult.</p>
<p>However, let‚Äôs now dive deep to first understand what exactly does a consumer-app required and how Push Chain completes those requirements.</p>
<p>Some of the main requirements of a consumer-centric applications are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Simplified User-Onboarding:</strong> Apps required seamless onboarding and intuitive user interface. In simpler terms, this indicates that applications should be so easy to use that the user should never have to learn the intricacies of the underlying technology stack.</p>
<p>However, its not the case in web3. The intuitiveness ends the moment users are required to <em>set up a web3 wallet and remember the mnemonics</em>. This means the very first step a user is required to do for using web3 apps will most likely be the most difficult step in itself.</p>
<p>Once the user enters the rabbit hole of using a web3 app, they are then required to either <em>choose a chain, sign a transaction, collect and manage native gas tokens of the respective chain, switch between different chains, bridge tokens, etc.</em> The list goes on and <strong><em>the further you explore, the harder the UX.</em></strong></p>
<p>With Wallet Abstraction, Push Chain aims to enable seamless user onboarding without going through the manual and complicated procedure of setting up a web3 wallet.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Eigth Image of Why Push Chain" src="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-943/assets/images/image8-70c78f84636ce3306181274bed509f46.webp" width="1036" height="898" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Wallet abstraction addresses challenges by removing the need for direct mnemonic management. Instead, Push Chain allows users to authenticate using familiar methods like <em>social logins, email, or phone numbers.</em> This system abstracts away the complexity of mnemonic custody by securely managing a master key pair on behalf of the user, while still ensuring they retain ultimate control.</p>
<p>The Push wallet can dynamically derive blockchain-specific keys from the master key pair, enabling seamless interaction across multiple blockchain networks. By simplifying wallet operations and providing a unified experience, wallet abstraction reduces friction, enhances usability, and makes blockchain technology more accessible without compromising security.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The whitepaper explains the Key Management and technical aspects around keys in greater detail. Check it out here</em></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Instant Finality &amp; Scalability:</strong> A consumer-centric app needs to support a large number of users without compromising performance. Additionally, it needs to support instant finality so that users experience a similar speed as in traditional apps.</p>
<p>Although layer 2 solutions and rollups aim to address scalability, the current state of web3 still struggles to match the speed and efficiency of traditional centralized systems. For a consumer-centric app, any delay in processing or finalizing transactions will lead to a poor user experience.</p>
<p><strong>Push Chain</strong> is designed to solve this with its instant finality as well as its support for unordered transactions, a.k.a, consumer transactions.</p>
<p>A consumer transaction can be defined as the type of transaction that doesn't benefit from the strict ordering as seen in traditional web3 transactions where strict ordering with a nonce is mandatory. These can also be categorized as transfers of consumer data like notifications, emails, blogs, etc that do not require a strict order to be executed.</p>
<p>Since there is no state change for such transactions, they don‚Äôt need to change the merkle root of the network and thus can be called <strong>orderless transactions.</strong></p>
<p>Examples of these transactions can be emails sent from one user to another, posting on social media, writing blogs, creating content, defining user settings for an app, defining user meta-data, storing soft state data for gaming among others.</p>
<p>The chain is designed to facilitate a wide range of consumer transactions, providing a robust and scalable platform for decentralized applications. The transaction model in the Push Chain is tailored to support high-throughput, low-latency operations, ensuring that various applications can interact seamlessly.</p>
<p><strong>Since scalability is crucial for any application, phase 1</strong> of the Push Chain roadmap includes the development of new optimization such as <strong>parallel block execution and dynamic sharding</strong> to create the true scaling of web3 apps, enabling read and write capabilities that scale as the number of nodes in the network scales, which provides an infrastructure that can handle the needs of thousands of applications related to speed and scalability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Affordability:</strong> A major pain point of using any app is the associated cost. If an app requires a user to spend a high as well as indeterministic cost every time he/she wishes to use the app - the user will most likely never use it.</p>
<p>Consumers expect low or no fees for transactions within apps, especially non-monetary ones. Gas fees, while necessary to secure the network, are a major barrier to consumer adoption. In web3, transaction fees are often too high for the average consumer; even more so during network congestion. However, solving this has been difficult as there is a always gas fees/network fees associated with any and every action a user might want to take.</p>
<p><strong>With Push Chain‚Äôs Fee Abstraction feature,</strong> we eliminate this problem to a greater extent.</p>
<p>Fee Abstraction is a key feature of this chain that eliminates the friction of requiring to hold native gas strictly in the wallet in use.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a sustainable decentralized network needs to be present in order to ensure the long-term viability of the project. To do this, we propose including a mechanism for having a fee quota.</p>
<p>A user is able to purchase fees in bulk that can then be used by them, delegated to other users / wallets or can even be paid by web3 applications. The key idea behind locking fees in bulk is to ensure that the transaction coming from whatever blockchain network is not limited by the speed of that particular blockchain‚Äôs TPS.</p>
<p>Additionally, there is a fallback mechanism that does a graceful conversion using swapper contracts which takes the native token of a specific blockchain and swaps it for Push Chain‚Äôs fees.</p>
<p>This ensures that in the event a different chain user doesn‚Äôt have enough fees, even then the network is still able to fallback and use that particular blockchain‚Äôs native token for the conversion and eventual processing of the transaction. This mechanism ensures that even running out of quota is not a barrier to transaction creation, providing flexibility in payment methods.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Concerns with Multi-Chain Navigation &amp; Fragmented Ecosystem</strong></p>
<p>As previously stated, a core reason behind difficult UX in web3 is the existence of multiple different chains. Each of these chains offers some key feature but eventually leads to a fragmented ecosystem.</p>
<p>If we observe the space as whole, carefully, it is quite evident that there are two main requirements for apps to navigate such an ecosystem:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fast and reliable movement of value and messages between chains ( <em>for both apps and users )</em></li>
<li>A shared state infrastructure that allows building apps that appear to work seamlessly in a unified fashion and give a <strong>shared app experience</strong> to the user - completely eradicating the complexity of navigating multiple chains for using apps.</li>
</ul>
<p>If an infrastructure achieves both of these for the apps built on top of it, it can ideally resolve the most difficult UX problem that exists in web3 apps today.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs exactly what Push Chain aims to solve in its Phase 2 and 3.</p>
<p><strong>With Phase 2</strong> of its roadmap, the chain aims to establish seamless interoperability between chains to enable cross-chain features in the apps. The interoperability shall be enabled using a solver network capable of instant cross-chain transactions to ensure better UX. The network shall be designed to move not just value but also arbitrary payloads that seamlessly transfer smart contract calls to other chains.</p>
<p>The main goals of this phase is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enable fast and reliable movement of messages/assets between chain</li>
<li>Delegate on-chain intricacies and risks from users to solvers ( <em>specialized on-chain actors )</em></li>
</ul>
<p>At the point in which both of these goals are accomplished, we will achieve a win for both the users and the apps on top of Push Chain.</p>
<p><strong>With Phase 3,</strong> we achieve the shared state L1 chain that is capable of supporting universal apps. Most importantly, this phase establishes one of the key features of Push Chain, i.e., <strong>shared app experiences</strong> (with Shared State).</p>
<p>Shared state allows Push Chain to access data from its own chain as well as supported external chains. Combining this with Push ID enables universal smart contracts wherein the smart contracts on Push Chain have access to the state of all of the wallets of the user even if those wallets belong to other chain(s). This enables developers to understand the user and build universal smart contracts to fulfill the user‚Äôs need irrespective of what chain(s) the user state is on which ushers countless innovations.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Ninth Image of Why Push Chain" src="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-943/assets/images/image9-0277bcf4353ad392efa0adcf75fb3894.webp" width="1364" height="1006" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>The feature opens up the entire web3 userbase to be available for a web3 application enabling shared app experiences no matter from what blockchain the user accesses the application. It also makes Push Chain the shared settlement layer for all other chains (EVM / Non-EVM).</p>
<p>This enables developers to completely abstract away any learning from the user, creating an era where a user does not use Uniswap ‚Äúon Ethereum‚Äù or Uniswap ‚Äúon Polygon‚Äù or Uniswap ‚Äúon Arbitrum‚Äù ‚Äî but rather simply <strong>uses Uniswap</strong> for its features.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[How Push Enhances Privacy in On-Chain Communications]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Cover Image of How Push Enhances Privacy in On-Chain Communications" src="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-943/assets/images/cover-image-46e5069477dd11a8d4139816c39aebab.webp" width="1920" height="1080" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>While privacy is fundamental to blockchain technology, communicating on-chain poses distinct challenges. Because wallet addresses are public by design, users face risks from unsolicited messages, data mining, and phishing attempts. This challenge requires a secure, private communication layer that preserves the decentralized nature of the blockchain. An effective solution must give users complete control over their data while allowing smooth, private interactions. Push Protocol addresses this need by enhancing privacy in on-chain communications without compromising usability or security.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="end-to-end-encryption-ensuring-message-privacy"><strong>End-to-End Encryption: Ensuring Message Privacy</strong><a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-943/blog/how-push-enhances-privacy-in-on-chain-communications#end-to-end-encryption-ensuring-message-privacy" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to end-to-end-encryption-ensuring-message-privacy" title="Direct link to end-to-end-encryption-ensuring-message-privacy">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>Push ensures that every message exchanged between users remains private, leveraging robust end-to-end encryption. This encryption ensures that only the sender and recipient can access the content, effectively safeguarding sensitive information from prying eyes.</p>
<p>When users register with Push Chat using their wallet, a unique public-private key pair is generated. This method removes the need for usernames or passwords, ensuring privacy by design. The private key stays securely within the user‚Äôs wallet, while the public key allows others to encrypt messages intended for them. For example, when User A sends a message to User B, the message is encrypted with User B's public key, ensuring that only User B‚Äîholding the corresponding private key‚Äîcan decrypt and read it.</p>
<p>This process, powered by asymmetric cryptography, guarantees that no third party can intercept or decipher the communication. By placing security and privacy at the core of its design, Push empowers user privacy, even in a decentralized environment.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="pgp-key-security-your-private-key-your-privacy"><strong>PGP Key Security: Your Private Key, Your Privacy</strong><a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-943/blog/how-push-enhances-privacy-in-on-chain-communications#pgp-key-security-your-private-key-your-privacy" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to pgp-key-security-your-private-key-your-privacy" title="Direct link to pgp-key-security-your-private-key-your-privacy">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>Push takes a decentralized approach to key management by generating and encrypting PGP keys locally on users' devices. These keys are protected using advanced encryption methods, ensuring only the user can access them. These private keys never leave the user‚Äôs control, ensuring that their communication remains secure. This commitment to decentralization ensures that privacy is not a feature to be toggled but a default guarantee for all Push users. Think of it as having your personal safe: only you hold the key, and no one else, not even Push, can open it.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="anonymous-communication-no-personal-information-required"><strong>Anonymous Communication: No Personal Information Required</strong><a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-943/blog/how-push-enhances-privacy-in-on-chain-communications#anonymous-communication-no-personal-information-required" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to anonymous-communication-no-personal-information-required" title="Direct link to anonymous-communication-no-personal-information-required">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>Unlike traditional platforms that require personal identifiers like email addresses or phone numbers, Push enables wallet-to-wallet messaging. This innovation allows users to communicate anonymously, relying solely on their Web3 wallets for identity. By removing the need for personal identifiers, Push eliminates the common risks of data breaches and misuse of personal information. This feature not only enhances privacy but also aligns with the principles of pseudonymity and anonymity by offering valuable protections and can be used to enhance privacy and security on the blockchain.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="decentralized-storage-with-ipfs"><strong>Decentralized Storage with IPFS</strong><a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-943/blog/how-push-enhances-privacy-in-on-chain-communications#decentralized-storage-with-ipfs" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to decentralized-storage-with-ipfs" title="Direct link to decentralized-storage-with-ipfs">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>Push stores messages securely on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), a decentralized storage solution that ensures data integrity and security. Using IPFS, Push ensures that data is distributed across multiple nodes, making it nearly impossible for hackers to tamper with or breach.</p>
<p>Push‚Äôs decentralized infrastructure minimizes security risks like data breaches while providing faster access to data and greater resilience. This approach ensures that even if one node fails, user messages remain accessible and secure, offering uninterrupted service.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="spam-prevention-for-better-privacy"><strong>Spam Prevention for Better Privacy</strong><a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-943/blog/how-push-enhances-privacy-in-on-chain-communications#spam-prevention-for-better-privacy" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to spam-prevention-for-better-privacy" title="Direct link to spam-prevention-for-better-privacy">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>Spam and unwanted messages can be significant privacy concerns. Push mitigates this with chat requests and opt-in notifications, empowering users to control who can contact them. Chat requests allow users to preview messages before accepting them, while opt-in notifications ensure that only chosen channels can send updates. This spam prevention mechanism ensures that users‚Äô communication remains meaningful and free from unnecessary intrusion.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="privacy-in-nft-and-token-gated-groups"><strong>Privacy in NFT and Token-Gated Groups</strong><a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-943/blog/how-push-enhances-privacy-in-on-chain-communications#privacy-in-nft-and-token-gated-groups" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to privacy-in-nft-and-token-gated-groups" title="Direct link to privacy-in-nft-and-token-gated-groups">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>Push goes beyond one-on-one messaging by enabling private group chats for NFT and token holders. Access to these groups is determined by ownership of specific NFTs or tokens, creating exclusive spaces for members. This functionality allows users to participate in exclusive communities without revealing personal information. Whether it‚Äôs an NFT club or a DAO working group, Push ensures that privacy is maintained across all interactions.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Cover Image of Ecosystem Integrations: How Push Works with Other Protocols" src="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-943/assets/images/cover-image-26765ba30880889b7618592693c7e2c3.webp" width="1920" height="1080" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>As the web3 ecosystem expands, seamless communication and timely information flow have become essential for effective user engagement and enhanced user experience. Push Protocol leads the way by providing on-chain notifications that integrate with essential DeFi, social, and DAO platforms. By enabling real-time updates, Push empowers users to stay informed, manage assets, and streamline their activities, supporting the decentralized ecosystem like never before.‚Äù Here's a look at how Push Protocol works with significant players like Lens Protocol, Hats Protocol, ENS Domains, Hyperliquid, and others to enhance the user experience and bring our decentralized ecosystem into an age of real-time communications.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="lens-protocol-real-time-notifications-for-social-engagement"><strong>Lens Protocol: Real-Time Notifications for Social Engagement</strong><a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-943/blog/how-push-works-with-other-protocols#lens-protocol-real-time-notifications-for-social-engagement" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to lens-protocol-real-time-notifications-for-social-engagement" title="Direct link to lens-protocol-real-time-notifications-for-social-engagement">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>Push Protocol enhances the user experience for Lens Protocol by delivering real-time notifications, creating a more engaging and interactive social ecosystem. Lens users can now receive notifications for critical events on their profiles, such as new followers, likes, and comments. This functionality ensures that users are always informed about activities related to their presence on the platform, making it easier to respond to interactions and engage with their community.</p>
<p>Through Push, Lens allows users to opt-in to receive these notifications directly in their wallets, creating a seamless Web3 experience that feels native and intuitive.&nbsp; By keeping users engaged and aware of important updates in real-time, Push helps maintain a lively and responsive social ecosystem within Lens.</p>
<p>As both the official Lens Protocol channel and the Push ecosystem continue to grow, it will be fascinating to see how developers expand upon the existing connections.</p>

<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="hats-protocol-streamlined-role-based-dao-communication"><strong>Hats Protocol: Streamlined, Role-Based DAO Communication</strong><a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-943/blog/how-push-works-with-other-protocols#hats-protocol-streamlined-role-based-dao-communication" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to hats-protocol-streamlined-role-based-dao-communication" title="Direct link to hats-protocol-streamlined-role-based-dao-communication">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>For DAOs that use Hats Protocol for decentralized role and permission management, Push Protocol offers token-gated group chat integrations. Hats Protocol's unique model of assigning "hats" or roles on-chain means that specific members are granted distinct responsibilities within a DAO. Push enhances this framework by enabling private group chats accessible only to members with particular hats, such as "Treasury Manager" or "Governance Lead."</p>
<p>This integration helps streamline communications within DAOs, ensuring that discussions remain relevant and focused by limiting access to members directly involved. By ensuring that only relevant members are part of each conversation, it increases efficiency and reduces noise, allowing DAOs to make faster, more informed decisions. It strengthens confidentiality and relevance in DAO interactions, keeping sensitive conversations secure and organized by the roles that are assigned by Hats Protocol.</p>
<p>With Hats injected into our token-gated group chats and beyond, we couldn‚Äôt be more bullish on the future of all communities. This setup not only improves security but also helps foster more collaborative, transparent and organized environments within DAO and beyond.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="ens-domains-ensuring-domain-retention-with-expiration-notifications"><strong>ENS Domains: Ensuring Domain Retention with Expiration Notifications</strong><a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-943/blog/how-push-works-with-other-protocols#ens-domains-ensuring-domain-retention-with-expiration-notifications" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to ens-domains-ensuring-domain-retention-with-expiration-notifications" title="Direct link to ens-domains-ensuring-domain-retention-with-expiration-notifications">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is a system that lets users replace long wallet addresses with easy-to-remember names (Domain Name Service - DNS) on the Ethereum blockchain.&nbsp; It is widely used for decentralized identity, allowing users to replace complex wallet addresses with easily recognizable names. However, managing ENS domains can be challenging, especially with expiration dates that can easily be missed.</p>
<p>In the fast paced world, staying on top of your decentralized identity is crucial. ENS Domain represents your identity, and letting them expire could mean losing access to vital services or communities. Push Protocol provides critical notifications for ENS holders when their domains are about to expire, allowing them to take timely action to avoid losing their names.</p>
<p>These notifications are sent straight to the user‚Äôs wallet, so they can quickly take action.&nbsp; No need to worry about missing emails or alerts elsewhere. This integration with Push enhances the user experience by safeguarding ENS ownership, reducing the risk of accidental lapses, and ensuring that users retain control over their decentralized identities.</p>

<p>In the fast-paced world of decentralized finance, Hyperliquid users benefit from Push Protocol's real-time alerts, which enable proactive risk management. For traders on Hyperliquid, staying on top of liquidation risks and position updates is essential. Push provides instant notifications to users' wallets, allowing them to manage risks, optimize trades, and act immediately when market conditions change.</p>
<p>This integration empowers DeFi users to make informed decisions in real-time, react quickly to price movements, and manage positions efficiently. It's a powerful tool for anyone trading in DeFi who wants to maximize their strategy and minimize risk.</p>

<p>Today, Push is used by many leading decentralized exchanges to notify traders of changes in their positions, changes in prices, and other use cases. Uniswap utilizes its Push channel to&nbsp; notify liquidity providers of significant changes in pool ratios, impermanent loss, or yield fluctuations. By keeping providers updated on the performance and risk of their assets, Push helps optimize liquidity management for decentralized exchanges. These real-time insights help liquidity providers make smarter decisions, manage risks better, and ultimately boost the liquidity and efficiency of decentralized markets.</p>

<p>Push Protocol is an excellent addition to governance platforms like Snapshot. Through Snapshot‚Äôs existing integration, DAOs and other on-chain communities can inform their community members about upcoming votes, results, and other governance actions. By using real-time notifications to ensure that users never miss an important vote or proposal update, Push is helping to encourage and increase active participation in DAO governance. Over time, <a href="https://push.org/blog/epns-partners-with-snapshot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as noted in our initial announcement</a>, we expect the integration to be even further expanded to account for the needs of the frequently changing governance landscape.</p>

<p>As the digital landscape shifts toward further decentralization, users' expectations around privacy, control, and engagement in their favorite chat platforms are evolving too.  <a href="https://push.org/docs/chat/#:~:text=Push%20Chat%20is%20a%20web3,numbers%2C%20email%20addresses%2C%20etc." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Push Chat</a>, the communication protocol of Web3 reimagines digital messaging by incorporating new technologies, improved UX, and user-first functionalities that traditional platforms like WhatsApp, Telegram, and Signal lack.</p>
<p>In this article, we dig deeper into what sets Push Chat apart.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="privacyanonymity-no-phone-number-or-email-required">Privacy+Anonymity: No Phone Number or Email Required<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-943/blog/how-push-chat-is-different-from-traditional-chat-platforms#privacyanonymity-no-phone-number-or-email-required" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Privacy+Anonymity: No Phone Number or Email Required" title="Direct link to Privacy+Anonymity: No Phone Number or Email Required">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>Traditional chat apps like WhatsApp and Telegram require a phone number or email to register, tying users to a specific identity, which can expose them to data tracking, phishing, or unwanted contacts. Push Chat bypasses this entirely. Users only need a <a href="https://push.org/docs/notifications/supported-wallet-standards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">compatible EVM wallet</a> to connect, meaning they can remain anonymous and communicate securely without compromising their identity while keeping personal data decentralized and user-controlled.</p>
<p>Unlike centralized platforms that store personal information on servers, Push Chat‚Äôs decentralized model gives users complete control over their data, removing the risk of centralized data leaks or misuse.</p>
<p>This approach aligns with the principles of decentralization, where privacy and ownership of data are prioritized, giving users a significant advantage over conventional platforms.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="spam-prevention-with-opt-in-chats">Spam Prevention with Opt-In Chats<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-943/blog/how-push-chat-is-different-from-traditional-chat-platforms#spam-prevention-with-opt-in-chats" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Spam Prevention with Opt-In Chats" title="Direct link to Spam Prevention with Opt-In Chats">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>Spam and unwanted messages are a common issue in traditional platforms. Push Chat employs a unique approach: it requires users to accept a request to chat before any conversation begins. This built-in spam filter means users won‚Äôt receive unsolicited messages unless they‚Äôve approved the contact, making for a more streamlined and distraction-free experience.</p>
<p>Traditional platforms often struggle with managing unsolicited contacts, relying heavily on manual blocking or report mechanisms, whereas Push Chat‚Äôs solution is proactive and user-friendly.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="public-key-cryptographypkc-for-message-encryption">Public Key Cryptography(PKC) for Message Encryption<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-943/blog/how-push-chat-is-different-from-traditional-chat-platforms#public-key-cryptographypkc-for-message-encryption" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Public Key Cryptography(PKC) for Message Encryption" title="Direct link to Public Key Cryptography(PKC) for Message Encryption">‚Äã</a></h3>
<p>Privacy-conscious users will appreciate that Push Chat ensures end-to-end encryption for all of its users. Although some traditional platforms like WhatsApp also provide this feature, Push Chat takes it a step further by using cryptography to ensure that messages remain private and can only be decrypted by the intended recipient.</p>
<p>When a user registers with Push Chat using their wallet, a public-private key pair is generated for them. The private key remains stored in the user‚Äôs wallet, while the public key is available for others to encrypt messages intended for that user. When User A sends a message to User B, Push Chat uses User B‚Äôs public key to encrypt the message. This ensures that only someone with the corresponding private key (User B) can decrypt and read it.</p>
<p>This encryption is achieved through asymmetric cryptography, a standard cryptographic technique where public keys are used to encrypt data and private keys to decrypt it. This setup makes it difficult for third parties to intercept messages, ensuring only the sender and recipient can read their conversations.</p>
<p>In summary, <a href="https://push.org/docs/chat/concepts/encryption-version-in-push-chat/#:~:text=Encryption%20in%20Push%20Chat,or%20decrypt%20your%20PGP%20keys" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Push Chat‚Äôs end-to-end encryption</a> leverages advanced cryptographic standards, entirely decentralized public-key management, and blockchain-based verification to ensure messages remain private, authenticated, and secure across the network.</p>

<p>Push Chat‚Äôs architecture is fundamentally decentralized, leveraging blockchain technology to enhance security and privacy. Messages are stored on IPFS, ensuring that data remains accessible yet tamper-proof, without relying on any central server. Traditional messaging platforms often store data on centralized servers, which act as single points of failure and make data more vulnerable to breaches. In contrast, Push Chat‚Äôs decentralized infrastructure minimizes these risks, ensuring that data remains secure and user-controlled. Additionally, all messages are validated by decentralized nodes in the Push Network, which verify sender authenticity and ensure the message integrity that centralized platforms can‚Äôt match. This decentralized setup gives users control over their data, with each message transaction backed by blockchain-grade security.</p>
