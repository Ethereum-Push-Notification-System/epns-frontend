        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How Push Enhances Privacy in On-Chain Communications]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Cover Image of How Push Enhances Privacy in On-Chain Communications" src="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-939/assets/images/cover-image-46e5069477dd11a8d4139816c39aebab.webp" width="1920" height="1080" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>While privacy is fundamental to blockchain technology, communicating on-chain poses distinct challenges. Because wallet addresses are public by design, users face risks from unsolicited messages, data mining, and phishing attempts. This challenge requires a secure, private communication layer that preserves the decentralized nature of the blockchain. An effective solution must give users complete control over their data while allowing smooth, private interactions. Push Protocol addresses this need by enhancing privacy in on-chain communications without compromising usability or security.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="end-to-end-encryption-ensuring-message-privacy"><strong>End-to-End Encryption: Ensuring Message Privacy</strong><a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-939/blog/how-push-enhances-privacy-in-on-chain-communications#end-to-end-encryption-ensuring-message-privacy" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to end-to-end-encryption-ensuring-message-privacy" title="Direct link to end-to-end-encryption-ensuring-message-privacy">​</a></h3>
<p>Push ensures that every message exchanged between users remains private, leveraging robust end-to-end encryption. This encryption ensures that only the sender and recipient can access the content, effectively safeguarding sensitive information from prying eyes.</p>
<p>When users register with Push Chat using their wallet, a unique public-private key pair is generated. This method removes the need for usernames or passwords, ensuring privacy by design. The private key stays securely within the user’s wallet, while the public key allows others to encrypt messages intended for them. For example, when User A sends a message to User B, the message is encrypted with User B's public key, ensuring that only User B—holding the corresponding private key—can decrypt and read it.</p>
<p>This process, powered by asymmetric cryptography, guarantees that no third party can intercept or decipher the communication. By placing security and privacy at the core of its design, Push empowers user privacy, even in a decentralized environment.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="pgp-key-security-your-private-key-your-privacy"><strong>PGP Key Security: Your Private Key, Your Privacy</strong><a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-939/blog/how-push-enhances-privacy-in-on-chain-communications#pgp-key-security-your-private-key-your-privacy" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to pgp-key-security-your-private-key-your-privacy" title="Direct link to pgp-key-security-your-private-key-your-privacy">​</a></h3>
<p>Push takes a decentralized approach to key management by generating and encrypting PGP keys locally on users' devices. These keys are protected using advanced encryption methods, ensuring only the user can access them. These private keys never leave the user’s control, ensuring that their communication remains secure. This commitment to decentralization ensures that privacy is not a feature to be toggled but a default guarantee for all Push users. Think of it as having your personal safe: only you hold the key, and no one else, not even Push, can open it.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="anonymous-communication-no-personal-information-required"><strong>Anonymous Communication: No Personal Information Required</strong><a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-939/blog/how-push-enhances-privacy-in-on-chain-communications#anonymous-communication-no-personal-information-required" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to anonymous-communication-no-personal-information-required" title="Direct link to anonymous-communication-no-personal-information-required">​</a></h3>
<p>Unlike traditional platforms that require personal identifiers like email addresses or phone numbers, Push enables wallet-to-wallet messaging. This innovation allows users to communicate anonymously, relying solely on their Web3 wallets for identity. By removing the need for personal identifiers, Push eliminates the common risks of data breaches and misuse of personal information. This feature not only enhances privacy but also aligns with the principles of pseudonymity and anonymity by offering valuable protections and can be used to enhance privacy and security on the blockchain.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="decentralized-storage-with-ipfs"><strong>Decentralized Storage with IPFS</strong><a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-939/blog/how-push-enhances-privacy-in-on-chain-communications#decentralized-storage-with-ipfs" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to decentralized-storage-with-ipfs" title="Direct link to decentralized-storage-with-ipfs">​</a></h3>
<p>Push stores messages securely on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), a decentralized storage solution that ensures data integrity and security. Using IPFS, Push ensures that data is distributed across multiple nodes, making it nearly impossible for hackers to tamper with or breach.</p>
<p>Push’s decentralized infrastructure minimizes security risks like data breaches while providing faster access to data and greater resilience. This approach ensures that even if one node fails, user messages remain accessible and secure, offering uninterrupted service.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="spam-prevention-for-better-privacy"><strong>Spam Prevention for Better Privacy</strong><a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-939/blog/how-push-enhances-privacy-in-on-chain-communications#spam-prevention-for-better-privacy" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to spam-prevention-for-better-privacy" title="Direct link to spam-prevention-for-better-privacy">​</a></h3>
<p>Spam and unwanted messages can be significant privacy concerns. Push mitigates this with chat requests and opt-in notifications, empowering users to control who can contact them. Chat requests allow users to preview messages before accepting them, while opt-in notifications ensure that only chosen channels can send updates. This spam prevention mechanism ensures that users’ communication remains meaningful and free from unnecessary intrusion.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="privacy-in-nft-and-token-gated-groups"><strong>Privacy in NFT and Token-Gated Groups</strong><a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-939/blog/how-push-enhances-privacy-in-on-chain-communications#privacy-in-nft-and-token-gated-groups" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to privacy-in-nft-and-token-gated-groups" title="Direct link to privacy-in-nft-and-token-gated-groups">​</a></h3>
<p>Push goes beyond one-on-one messaging by enabling private group chats for NFT and token holders. Access to these groups is determined by ownership of specific NFTs or tokens, creating exclusive spaces for members. This functionality allows users to participate in exclusive communities without revealing personal information. Whether it’s an NFT club or a DAO working group, Push ensures that privacy is maintained across all interactions.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="cross-chain-privacy"><strong>Cross-Chain Privacy</strong><a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-939/blog/how-push-enhances-privacy-in-on-chain-communications#cross-chain-privacy" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to cross-chain-privacy" title="Direct link to cross-chain-privacy">​</a></h3>
<p>As Web3 grows increasingly multi-chain, Push ensures seamless and private communication across blockchain networks. This is achieved using advanced encryption and decentralized architecture, ensuring messages remain secure no matter the blockchain. This cross-chain capability fosters decentralized collaboration while upholding privacy principles in diverse ecosystems.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="the-future-of-onchain-communication"><strong>The Future of Onchain Communication</strong><a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-939/blog/how-push-enhances-privacy-in-on-chain-communications#the-future-of-onchain-communication" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to the-future-of-onchain-communication" title="Direct link to the-future-of-onchain-communication">​</a></h3>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How Push Chat is Different from Traditional Chat Platforms?]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Cover image of How Push Chat is Different from Traditional Chat Platforms" src="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-939/assets/images/cover-image-5f71ebf14c55e14664855997b359f4d7.webp" width="1280" height="720" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>As the digital landscape shifts toward further decentralization, users' expectations around privacy, control, and engagement in their favorite chat platforms are evolving too.  <a href="https://push.org/docs/chat/#:~:text=Push%20Chat%20is%20a%20web3,numbers%2C%20email%20addresses%2C%20etc." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Push Chat</a>, the communication protocol of Web3 reimagines digital messaging by incorporating new technologies, improved UX, and user-first functionalities that traditional platforms like WhatsApp, Telegram, and Signal lack.</p>
<p>In this article, we dig deeper into what sets Push Chat apart.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="privacyanonymity-no-phone-number-or-email-required">Privacy+Anonymity: No Phone Number or Email Required<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-939/blog/how-push-chat-is-different-from-traditional-chat-platforms#privacyanonymity-no-phone-number-or-email-required" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Privacy+Anonymity: No Phone Number or Email Required" title="Direct link to Privacy+Anonymity: No Phone Number or Email Required">​</a></h3>
<p>Traditional chat apps like WhatsApp and Telegram require a phone number or email to register, tying users to a specific identity, which can expose them to data tracking, phishing, or unwanted contacts. Push Chat bypasses this entirely. Users only need a <a href="https://push.org/docs/notifications/supported-wallet-standards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">compatible EVM wallet</a> to connect, meaning they can remain anonymous and communicate securely without compromising their identity while keeping personal data decentralized and user-controlled.</p>
<p>Unlike centralized platforms that store personal information on servers, Push Chat’s decentralized model gives users complete control over their data, removing the risk of centralized data leaks or misuse.</p>
<p>This approach aligns with the principles of decentralization, where privacy and ownership of data are prioritized, giving users a significant advantage over conventional platforms.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="spam-prevention-with-opt-in-chats">Spam Prevention with Opt-In Chats<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-939/blog/how-push-chat-is-different-from-traditional-chat-platforms#spam-prevention-with-opt-in-chats" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Spam Prevention with Opt-In Chats" title="Direct link to Spam Prevention with Opt-In Chats">​</a></h3>
<p>Spam and unwanted messages are a common issue in traditional platforms. Push Chat employs a unique approach: it requires users to accept a request to chat before any conversation begins. This built-in spam filter means users won’t receive unsolicited messages unless they’ve approved the contact, making for a more streamlined and distraction-free experience.</p>
<p>Traditional platforms often struggle with managing unsolicited contacts, relying heavily on manual blocking or report mechanisms, whereas Push Chat’s solution is proactive and user-friendly.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="public-key-cryptographypkc-for-message-encryption">Public Key Cryptography(PKC) for Message Encryption<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-939/blog/how-push-chat-is-different-from-traditional-chat-platforms#public-key-cryptographypkc-for-message-encryption" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Public Key Cryptography(PKC) for Message Encryption" title="Direct link to Public Key Cryptography(PKC) for Message Encryption">​</a></h3>
<p>Privacy-conscious users will appreciate that Push Chat ensures end-to-end encryption for all of its users. Although some traditional platforms like WhatsApp also provide this feature, Push Chat takes it a step further by using cryptography to ensure that messages remain private and can only be decrypted by the intended recipient.</p>
<p>When a user registers with Push Chat using their wallet, a public-private key pair is generated for them. The private key remains stored in the user’s wallet, while the public key is available for others to encrypt messages intended for that user. When User A sends a message to User B, Push Chat uses User B’s public key to encrypt the message. This ensures that only someone with the corresponding private key (User B) can decrypt and read it.</p>
<p>This encryption is achieved through asymmetric cryptography, a standard cryptographic technique where public keys are used to encrypt data and private keys to decrypt it. This setup makes it difficult for third parties to intercept messages, ensuring only the sender and recipient can read their conversations.</p>
<p>In summary, <a href="https://push.org/docs/chat/concepts/encryption-version-in-push-chat/#:~:text=Encryption%20in%20Push%20Chat,or%20decrypt%20your%20PGP%20keys" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Push Chat’s end-to-end encryption</a> leverages advanced cryptographic standards, entirely decentralized public-key management, and blockchain-based verification to ensure messages remain private, authenticated, and secure across the network.</p>

Frames enable developers and other projects to build a mini-web app, which, once shared in a Push Chat, will be embedded as an interactive, rich mini-app that anyone can interact with from within the chat. With this implementation of Frames, developers have the flexibility to do a variety of things, including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>On-Chain Interactions</strong>: Users can perform actions like staking tokens, voting on governance proposals, or claiming rewards, all directly within Push Chat, enhancing ease and accessibility.</li>
<li><strong>Gamification and Utilities</strong>: Frames can facilitate engaging features, such as community games, NFT rarity checkers, or DAO-specific utilities, all tailored to user contexts for added functionality and fun.</li>
<li><strong>Integrated Product Use</strong>: Projects can leverage Frames to provide direct access to services like swapping tokens, accessing DeFi tools, or exploring digital collectibles, without users needing to leave the Push Chat environment.</li>
<li>Letting users interact with their contracts, such as performing actions on-chain in any of the supported chains in Push Dapp.</li>
<li>Allowing Frames developers to build gamified, rich apps with user contexts, enabling powerful utilities and actions.</li>
<li>Letting users directly use their products without having to leave the Push Chat client.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a significant leap from the static nature of most traditional chats, where content is limited to media and text. With Farcaster Frames, Push Chat allows users to embed interactive experiences, making discussions more vibrant and personalized.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="enhanced-security-through-decentralized-infrastructure"><strong>Enhanced Security Through Decentralized Infrastructure</strong><a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-939/blog/how-push-chat-is-different-from-traditional-chat-platforms#enhanced-security-through-decentralized-infrastructure" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to enhanced-security-through-decentralized-infrastructure" title="Direct link to enhanced-security-through-decentralized-infrastructure">​</a></h3>
<p>Push Chat’s architecture is fundamentally decentralized, leveraging blockchain technology to enhance security and privacy. Messages are stored on IPFS, ensuring that data remains accessible yet tamper-proof, without relying on any central server. Traditional messaging platforms often store data on centralized servers, which act as single points of failure and make data more vulnerable to breaches. In contrast, Push Chat’s decentralized infrastructure minimizes these risks, ensuring that data remains secure and user-controlled. Additionally, all messages are validated by decentralized nodes in the Push Network, which verify sender authenticity and ensure the message integrity that centralized platforms can’t match. This decentralized setup gives users control over their data, with each message transaction backed by blockchain-grade security.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="its-ecosystem-integration-potential"><strong>Its Ecosystem Integration Potential</strong><a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-939/blog/how-push-chat-is-different-from-traditional-chat-platforms#its-ecosystem-integration-potential" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to its-ecosystem-integration-potential" title="Direct link to its-ecosystem-integration-potential">​</a></h3>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Cover Image of What is Decentralized Social Media and Why Does it Matter?" src="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-939/assets/images/cover-image-cc72de1f1ec0eb6feaeeb4d0bce09d00.webp" width="1920" height="1080" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>In today's world, social media is one of the most important ways we connect, share, and express ourselves. Centralized platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram have, to date, dominated the landscape. However, they come with significant drawbacks: they control user data, moderate content arbitrarily, and are driven by algorithms that prioritize selective monetization over genuine interaction.</p>
<p>Decentralized social media marks a pivotal shift in how we engage in our favorite spaces online. It's not just a fleeting trend—it's a movement poised to redefine online interactions, ownership, and privacy. By offering an alternative to the status quo, decentralized social media empowers users with unprecedented control over their data, social connections, and digital identities. This article will explore what decentralized social media is, its significance, and how innovative platforms such as Farcaster, Lens Protocol, Cyber, and Push Protocol are spearheading this transformation.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="verifiable-data-ownership-and-better-privacy"><strong>Verifiable Data Ownership and Better Privacy</strong><a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-939/blog/what-is-decentralized-social-media#verifiable-data-ownership-and-better-privacy" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to verifiable-data-ownership-and-better-privacy" title="Direct link to verifiable-data-ownership-and-better-privacy">​</a></h2>
<p>A crucial difference between centralized and decentralized social media is their approach to data ownership. On traditional platforms like Facebook, Instagram, or X (formerly Twitter), users relinquish control of their data from the moment they sign up. Every post, comment, like, and share is stored on company-owned servers and used to serve ads or fine-tune engagement algorithms. Users have little to no say in how their data is used, sold, or manipulated.</p>
<p>At its core, decentralized social media empowers users by giving them back control over their data. By utilizing blockchain technology, decentralized social platforms ensure that users retain control over their personal information and interactions. No single entity has the power to censor, delete, or exploit this data without the user's consent. This shift from platform-owned to user-owned data is a crucial step toward building a more open, transparent, and privacy-respecting social media landscape. This shift is already underway, as evidenced by the examples we'll explore below.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="composable--decentralized-social-graphs-lens-protocol"><strong>Composable &amp; Decentralized Social Graphs: Lens Protocol</strong><a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-939/blog/what-is-decentralized-social-media#composable--decentralized-social-graphs-lens-protocol" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to composable--decentralized-social-graphs-lens-protocol" title="Direct link to composable--decentralized-social-graphs-lens-protocol">​</a></h2>
<p>A key innovation of decentralized social media is the concept of composable social graphs. On traditional platforms, a user's social graph (their collection of connections, followers, and interactions) is locked away by the provider. If said user wants to switch to a new platform, they lose access to all of the relationships they’ve built and the content they may have curated or created. On decentralized platforms, your social graph—your relationships, posts, and interactions—can be seamlessly transferred across any app supporting the same protocol.</p>
<p>Lens Protocol is a prime example of how decentralized social media can empower users to take full ownership of their online identity and social graph. Built on Polygon, Lens offers users composable profiles that can interact with a variety of social dApps supported by its foundational network. No matter what dApp they use to choose, Lens users truly own their social graph as an NFT. This means that it is always possible to move between different dApps (decentralized applications) without having to rebuild their audience or connections. This level of portability is made possible through blockchain technology, fostering a more interoperable and user-friendly decentralized social ecosystem.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="dynamic-social-engagement-farcaster-frames"><strong>Dynamic Social Engagement: Farcaster Frames</strong><a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-939/blog/what-is-decentralized-social-media#dynamic-social-engagement-farcaster-frames" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to dynamic-social-engagement-farcaster-frames" title="Direct link to dynamic-social-engagement-farcaster-frames">​</a></h2>
<p>Farcaster via its primary client, Warpcast, illustrates how decentralized social media can be more engaging and empowering for users. They not only allow users to own their social graph and content but also introduce a novel feature called "Frames,” which we’re integrating <a href="https://gov.push.org/t/bringing-frames-interactive-mini-apps-to-push-network/1659" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">into the Push Protocol ecosystem</a>.</p>
<p>Frames are interactive, modular spaces within posts (known as "Casts" on Farcaster via Warpcast) where users can embed dynamic content such as polls, live updates, or even full-scale applications.</p>
<p>The launch of Frames has already enabled entirely new forms of interaction and engagement that go beyond what was possible before. Web-based content goes from its current, fairly static state to the equivalent of an application in and of itself. What about literal instant check-out for orders? Imagine being able to vote on a DAO proposal, stream a podcast, trade crypto or NFTs, and subscribe to a creator or channel—all within the same post. That’s a kind of composability that centralized platforms simply can’t match. By allowing users to organize and showcase the content they find most meaningful, Frames create a more personalized and context-driven experience. Though it’s early, Frames are already a key cog in the machine that represents the future of all social media.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="an-improved-streamlined-user-experience-cyber"><strong>An Improved, Streamlined User Experience: Cyber</strong><a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-939/blog/what-is-decentralized-social-media#an-improved-streamlined-user-experience-cyber" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to an-improved-streamlined-user-experience-cyber" title="Direct link to an-improved-streamlined-user-experience-cyber">​</a></h2>
<p>Cyber, a Layer 2 solution built on Optimism's Superchain and hyper-optimized for web3 social interactions aims to a user experience on par with apps that are already household names on the legacy web. It achieves this by addressing key usability challenges and boosting the scalability and performance of decentralized platforms.</p>
<p>Traditional blockchain platforms can also be clunky for users unfamiliar with managing private keys, wallets, and on-chain transactions. Cyber addresses this by incorporating built-in account abstraction and seedless wallets, delivering a frictionless user experience. Account abstraction simplifies wallet management by abstracting the complexities of managing multiple accounts and private keys away from the user. Seedless wallets, on the other hand, eliminate the need for cumbersome recovery phrases. Together, these features allow users to interact with decentralized apps and platforms as easily as they would with centralized services—without compromising security or ownership.</p>
<p>As social interactions become more complex and require faster processing times, Layer 2 solutions like Cyber will become increasingly important for both developers and users.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="decentralized-cross-chain-communication-push"><strong>Decentralized Cross-Chain Communication: Push</strong><a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-939/blog/what-is-decentralized-social-media#decentralized-cross-chain-communication-push" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to decentralized-cross-chain-communication-push" title="Direct link to decentralized-cross-chain-communication-push">​</a></h2>
<p>Platforms like <strong>Push Protocol</strong>, with its <strong>Push Chat</strong> feature, add a layer of utility by offering decentralized messaging systems. Unlike traditional messaging platforms, Push Chat enables encrypted, peer-to-peer communication, where users retain complete control over their conversations. The integration of notifications is another major win—decentralized push notifications ensure users stay updated on critical events, such as governance proposals, NFT drops, or community votes, all without relying on centralized servers.</p>
<p>Soon to be <a href="https://www.notion.so/Abstracting-away-Chains-for-a-better-UX-5fc5796918aa47ed8619a72d3bd01af9?pvs=21" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cross-chain</a>, Push Chat will allow users to communicate across multiple blockchain networks, making it a powerful tool for decentralized communication and breaking down the silos between separate ecosystems. By enabling cross-chain communication, Push Chat opens up seamless interaction for users in decentralized communities, governance, and beyond.</p>
<p>Whether it's notifying users of governance proposals, sending updates on decentralized projects, <a href="https://push.org/blog/hyper-scalable-group-chats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">facilitating hyper-scalable group chats</a>, or supporting the future of comms, social, gaming, and generally innovative apps through its grants program, Push is setting a new standard for decentralized communication tools and applications.</p>
<p>As Push Chat and Push Protocol itself continue to evolve, they will become even more important for decentralized social networks, since together, they allow users to communicate seamlessly across different dApps and ecosystems.&nbsp; Cross-chain functionality is a game-changer for both social interaction and decentralized governance, as it breaks down the barriers between blockchain networks. Push’s commitment to <a href="https://push.org/blog/cross-chain-requests-pre-pip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">enabling Cross-Chain Requests</a> demonstrates the team’s commitment to being a forerunner in that respect.</p>

<p>Decentralized social media offers a transformative approach to how we interact online, empowering users with ownership of their data, social graphs, and communication channels. Ultimately, decentralized social media is about more than just freedom from centralized control—it’s about creating a fairer, more user-centric web. By embracing decentralized platforms, we can take back control of our online identities and interactions. We will also be able to explore new models of engagement that are transparent, innovative, and built for the benefit of the user, not the platform.</p>
<p>This shift is not just inevitable; it’s necessary.</p>
<p>As we become more aware of the limitations and risks of centralized social networks, the move toward decentralized alternatives will accelerate. More users, developers, and creators will flock to platforms like <strong>Farcaster</strong>, <strong>Lens</strong>, <strong>Cyber</strong>, and <strong>Push Protocol</strong>. We’ll begin to see a new era of online interaction—one that puts users at the center of everything and further connects our nascent industry, building a better, more equitable internet for all.</p>
<p>All of the frameworks, networks, and projects mentioned here are key partners of Push Protocol and its DAO. Inside Push DAO, we believe that together with these groups and all of Push’s partners, we’ll build a truly impactful future for online communication and the internet at large.</p>
<p>Together, we'll make web3 the prevailing reality.</p>
<p><a href="https://gov.push.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reach out to the DAO</a> and we’ll get you plugged in with the ecosystem’s grants program, which is now undergoing an exciting evolution in preparation for 2025.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Why Do On-Chain Push Notifications Matter?]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Cover image of Why Do On-Chain Push Notifications Matter" src="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-939/assets/images/cover-image-75f68f486f9c51c40114b77e1f9c16e7.webp" width="1920" height="1080" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>In the fast-moving Web3 space, new developments and breakthroughs emerge at breakneck speeds, so staying informed and ahead of the curve is essential. However, most decentralized applications (dApps) lack native notification systems, leaving users in the dark when critical on-chain events occur. This is where push notifications, an on-chain communications primitive developed by Push Protocol, become crucial.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="dapps-lack-native-notifications"><strong>dApps Lack Native Notifications</strong><a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-939/blog/why-onchain-push-notifications-matter#dapps-lack-native-notifications" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to dapps-lack-native-notifications" title="Direct link to dapps-lack-native-notifications">​</a></h2>
<p>Most Web3 applications operate in a decentralized manner. They often don't include native push notifications like their Web2 counterparts (aka notifications you would receive from apps like WhatsApp or X). In the case of traditional apps, push notifications keep users updated on essential activities—whether it's a message from a friend or a reminder to pay bills. dApps, by contrast, typically require users to manually check their wallets or dashboards for updates, creating a less-than-user-friendly experience.</p>
<p>Without notifications, users can easily miss key events like:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Price movements of their favorite assets</strong></li>
<li><strong>Governance proposal updates in DAOs</strong></li>
<li><strong>Liquidation alerts in DeFi platforms</strong></li>
<li><strong>The latest publications from their chosen web3 news platform</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This gap is more than a mere inconvenience; it affects user engagement, asset security, and decision-making.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="so-why-do-on-chain-push-notifications-matter"><strong>So Why Do On-Chain Push Notifications Matter?</strong><a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-939/blog/why-onchain-push-notifications-matter#so-why-do-on-chain-push-notifications-matter" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to so-why-do-on-chain-push-notifications-matter" title="Direct link to so-why-do-on-chain-push-notifications-matter">​</a></h2>

<p>In the rapidly evolving landscape of Web3, user experience (UX) remains a pivotal factor in driving adoption and sustaining engagement.</p>
<p>One of the key innovations and the current <em>hot</em> narrative of web3 aiming to improve the overall UX of web3 apps is <strong>Chain Abstraction</strong>.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, Chain Abstraction aims to create a seamless and intuitive experience for users and developers, by simplifying interactions across multiple blockchain networks, bridging the gap between complex blockchain mechanics and everyday usability.</p>
<p>This article delves into the core concept of Chain Abstraction, explores its technical benefits, underscores its significance for the broader Web3 vision, and highlights what we at Push are doing to improve the UX of our applications.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="first-lets-understand-chain-abstraction">First, Let’s Understand Chain Abstraction<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-939/blog/abstracting-chains-for-better-dapp-ux#first-lets-understand-chain-abstraction" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to First, Let’s Understand Chain Abstraction" title="Direct link to First, Let’s Understand Chain Abstraction">​</a></h2>
<p><strong>Chain Abstraction</strong> refers to the combined effort of hiding the complexities associated with interacting with multiple blockchain networks, allowing users and developers to engage with decentralized applications (dApps) without needing to manage the intricacies of each underlying chain. Essentially, it acts as an intermediary layer that simplifies cross-chain interactions, enabling seamless communication and functionality across diverse blockchain ecosystems.</p>
<p>The fundamental idea behind Chain Abstraction is to create a unified user experience that abstracts away the differences between various blockchain protocols.</p>
<p>This means that users can perform actions on a dApp without having to switch networks, manage multiple wallets, or understand the technical nuances of each blockchain. By streamlining these interactions, Chain Abstraction aims to make Web3 more accessible and user-friendly, fostering broader adoption and sustained engagement.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="enhancing-web3-dapp-ux-through-chain-abstraction">Enhancing Web3 dApp UX Through Chain Abstraction<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-939/blog/abstracting-chains-for-better-dapp-ux#enhancing-web3-dapp-ux-through-chain-abstraction" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Enhancing Web3 dApp UX Through Chain Abstraction" title="Direct link to Enhancing Web3 dApp UX Through Chain Abstraction">​</a></h2>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="simplified-user-interactions">Simplified User Interactions<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-939/blog/abstracting-chains-for-better-dapp-ux#simplified-user-interactions" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Simplified User Interactions" title="Direct link to Simplified User Interactions">​</a></h3>
<p>One of the primary benefits of Chain Abstraction is the simplification of user interactions with dApps. Currently, users often need to switch between different blockchain networks to access various functionalities, which can be cumbersome and deter non-technical users.</p>
<p>Here is a quick glance at what the typical web3 user needs to deal with today in this multi-chain web3 ecosystem:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>managing multiple wallets,</em></li>
<li><em>managing multiple native tokens/assets in their multiple wallets,</em></li>
<li><em>understanding the nuances of each network,</em></li>
<li><em>navigating multiple networks to perform simple tasks,</em></li>
<li><em>interacting with complicated dApp UIs with frequent network switching,</em></li>
<li><em>navigate through inconsistent user interfaces,</em></li>
<li><em>relying on the risky route of cross-chain bridging between chains,</em></li>
<li><em>experiencing difficulty in maintaining a consistent cross-chain identity due to the multi-chain ecosystem,</em></li>
<li><em>dealing with the lack of standardization between networks, protocols, etc.</em></li>
<li><em>dealing with the learning curve of understanding different networks, each with its own set of rules, interfaces, and requirements.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Remember that this is just a glance at the UX problem. There are undoubtedly more issues that an experienced web3 user faces daily. The list is even longer when it comes to newbie web3 users.</p>
<p>However, with Chain Abstraction, most of it gets abstracted away.</p>
<p>In other words, chain abstraction shall allow users to only perform the bare minimum actions and delegate all others to specialized on-chain or off-chain actors. These actors can simply take the user’s intent and themselves figure out the best route, chain, transaction order, etc to fulfill the user’s request.</p>
<p>This means that the user can have a significantly simplified on-chain interaction where most of the multi-chain-specific complicated tasks will be abstracted away from them, thus improving the overall UX for an average Joe.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="unified-wallet-management">Unified Wallet Management<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-939/blog/abstracting-chains-for-better-dapp-ux#unified-wallet-management" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Unified Wallet Management" title="Direct link to Unified Wallet Management">​</a></h3>
<p>Managing multiple wallets across different chains is another pain point for users.</p>
<p>Chain Abstraction addresses this by enabling a single wallet interface that can interact with multiple blockchains. This reduces the cognitive load on users, allowing them to manage their digital assets more efficiently as well as more securely from a single platform.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="seamless-cross-chain-transactions">Seamless Cross-Chain Transactions<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-939/blog/abstracting-chains-for-better-dapp-ux#seamless-cross-chain-transactions" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Seamless Cross-Chain Transactions" title="Direct link to Seamless Cross-Chain Transactions">​</a></h3>
<p>Chain Abstraction facilitates seamless cross-chain transactions, eliminating the need for manual bridging or swapping of assets. This not only enhances the speed and efficiency of transactions but also reduces the risk of errors and the potential security vulnerabilities associated with manual bridging processes.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="enhanced-performance-and-scalability">Enhanced Performance and Scalability<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-939/blog/abstracting-chains-for-better-dapp-ux#enhanced-performance-and-scalability" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Enhanced Performance and Scalability" title="Direct link to Enhanced Performance and Scalability">​</a></h3>
<p>Chain Abstraction can also contribute to improved performance and scalability of dApps. By leveraging the strengths of multiple blockchains, dApps can optimize transaction speeds and reduce congestion on any single network.</p>
<p>This distributed approach ensures that dApps remain responsive and efficient, even as user demand grows.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="security-and-reliability">Security and Reliability<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-939/blog/abstracting-chains-for-better-dapp-ux#security-and-reliability" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Security and Reliability" title="Direct link to Security and Reliability">​</a></h3>
<p>While traditional interop or bridging solutions often introduce multiple points of vulnerability. For instance, the reliance on centralized validators or relayers can lead to potential breaches if these entities are compromised. Additionally, bridges typically depend on complex smart contracts and multi-signature schemes, which, if not meticulously audited, become prime targets for attackers. Historical incidents have underscored these risks, with a substantial portion of stolen crypto funds originating from bridge exploits. Most of the <a href="https://medium.com/immunefi/common-cross-chain-bridge-vulnerabilities-d8c161ffaf8f" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">massive crypto hacks</a> in the past have occurred through compromised bridges, highlighting the critical need for more secure cross-chain solutions.</p>
<p>In contrast, Chain Abstraction minimizes these risks by shrinking down the attack surface area to a greater extent as it reduces direct user interactions with various chains. Instead of users navigating multiple networks and managing separate security protocols, Chain Abstraction delegates these responsibilities to specialized on-chain actors, such as intent handlers or solvers.</p>
<p>This delegation not only streamlines the user experience but also centralizes security oversight, allowing for more effective and consistent application of security measures. By handling transactions through a unified interface, Chain Abstraction can implement robust security protocols that ensure transactions are validated and processed securely across all supported chains.</p>
<p>However, it's important to recognize that Chain Abstraction introduces new points of security consideration. The addition of abstraction layers and off-chain components, like handlers or solvers, necessitates a reevaluation of the security framework. While these layers reduce the attack surface by limiting direct interactions with multiple chains, they also require their own stringent security measures. Ensuring the integrity and security of these new components is crucial, as any vulnerabilities within the abstraction layer could potentially compromise the entire system.</p>

<p>At Push Protocol, we have consistently focused on enhancing the user experience, not only for Push’s own community but also for the entire Web3 ecosystem.</p>
<p>Since the launch of our dApp, we have prioritized a <a href="https://push.org/blog/the-rise-of-chains-and-fall-of-ux-in-web3-ux/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UX-driven</a> and security-first strategy.</p>
<p>Whether we’re refining the visual interface, optimizing our smart contracts, or implementing gasless opt-ins for seamless dApp interactions, we remain dedicated to these principles across all facets of our platform.</p>
<p>However, improving UX in web3 involves far more than just building intuitive user interfaces for our applications.</p>
<p>In a multi-chain ecosystem, users have to deal with a lot more complexities, as previously mentioned in this article.</p>
<p>Since Push Protocol supports more than one EVM chain (<em>and soon will support non-evm chains),</em> our dApp’s UX needs to be improved accordingly.</p>
<p>There is a need for us to ensure we abstract away all the multi-chain complexity for our users and provide a single unified interface for them to use.</p>
<p>And, we do this with the <a href="https://gov.push.org/t/pre-pip-3-cross-chain-request-feature-in-push-smart-contracts-v3/1794" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Cross Chain Request Feature.</strong></a></p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="what-is-cross-chain-requests-ccr">What is Cross Chain Requests (CCR)?<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-939/blog/abstracting-chains-for-better-dapp-ux#what-is-cross-chain-requests-ccr" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is Cross Chain Requests (CCR)?" title="Direct link to What is Cross Chain Requests (CCR)?">​</a></h3>

<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="what-are-token-gated-group-chats"><strong>What Are Token-Gated Group Chats?</strong><a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-939/blog/token-gated-group-chats#what-are-token-gated-group-chats" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to what-are-token-gated-group-chats" title="Direct link to what-are-token-gated-group-chats">​</a></h3>
<p>Token-gated group chats are web3 native communication spaces where access is restricted based on the ownership of specific blockchain assets such as tokens or NFTs (non-fungible tokens). To put it even more simply, users must hold a certain token or NFT in their wallet to be granted entry to these exclusive group chats. This concept leverages the power of the different <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ERC token</a> standard technologies, offering decentralized and permissionless access control to on-chain communities.</p>
<p>These gated communities are becoming an increasingly popular option across all sorts of web3 groups, including DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations), NFT collector groups, and on-chain role holders. By tokenizing access, these chats provide a powerful tool for enhancing privacy, fostering trust, and building a strong sense of belonging.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="how-do-token-gated-group-chats-work"><strong>How Do Token-Gated Group Chats Work?</strong><a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-939/blog/token-gated-group-chats#how-do-token-gated-group-chats-work" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to how-do-token-gated-group-chats-work" title="Direct link to how-do-token-gated-group-chats-work">​</a></h3>
<p>First, token-gated chats depend on the accurate verification of the assets in a user’s blockchain wallet. In the case of Push’s gated chats, Push Protocol authenticates a user's wallet holdings to ensure they possess the required token or NFT to join the chat. The authentication is automatic, eliminating the need for traditional usernames, passwords, or email sign-ups. This process is seamless, privacy-focused, and ensures that only eligible users gain access to the chat or chats involved.</p>
<p>All of it is done in a matter of minutes.</p>
<p>Once authenticated, users can join discussions, receive exclusive content, participate in community governance, and more—making these group chats integral to any on-chain community.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="why-do-we-need-token-gated-group-chats"><strong>Why Do We Need Token-Gated Group Chats?</strong><a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-939/blog/token-gated-group-chats#why-do-we-need-token-gated-group-chats" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to why-do-we-need-token-gated-group-chats" title="Direct link to why-do-we-need-token-gated-group-chats">​</a></h3>
<p>The need for token-gated group chats stems from the growing demand for decentralized, transparent, and secure community management tools and workstreams in the web3 space.</p>
<p>Below, we’ve compiled several examples of current and future use cases:</p>
<p><strong>1. Exclusive Access for DAOs:</strong></p>
<p>For DAOs, token-gated group chats offer a mechanism to ensure that only voting members or contributors with skin in the game can participate in decision-making discussions. By using governance tokens as the entry key, DAOs can securely manage spaces where they want only a certain threshold of token holders to participate and share opinions.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Benefits</strong>: Having tokenized group chata strengthens governance processes by ensuring that only active, vested members are involved in the DAO's core operations, reducing noise and improving engagement quality.</li>
<li><strong>Use Case</strong>: DAOs like MakerDAO or Uniswap could create token-gated group chats for core governance contributors or voting members, creating secure spaces for key discussions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Community Building for NFT Collectors:</strong></p>
<p>NFT projects are built on the idea of exclusive ownership, and token-gated chats are a natural extension of this exclusivity. By allowing only verified NFT holders into private chat rooms, project creators can cultivate tight-knit communities that feel valued, special, and more closely connected to artists, founders, or whoever else the holders bought the NFT to support.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Benefits</strong>: NFT owners get a space where they can engage directly with creators and fellow collectors, access exclusive content, and receive early updates or airdrops.</li>
<li><strong>Use Case</strong>: A popular NFT collection like Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) might use a token-gated chat to offer holders access to exclusive discussions about future projects, merchandise drops, or events.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Enhanced Security and Privacy:</strong></p>
<p>Token-gated group chats inherently provide a higher level of privacy and security compared to traditional centralized platforms. By using cryptographic wallets as authentication, users no longer need to rely on third-party platforms that store personal data. This aligns with the ethos of decentralization and significantly reduces the risks of hacking or data breaches.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Benefits</strong>: No usernames or passwords or any storage of any sort of personal documents is required and there is no risk of sensitive personal information being leaked.</li>
<li><strong>Use Case</strong>: Communities concerned with privacy, like those focused on anonymous or pseudonymous interactions, can use token-gated chats to ensure secure and private communication.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Direct Monetization of Communities:</strong></p>
<p>For content creators and influencers, token-gated chats provide a unique opportunity to monetize access to their communities. By selling tokens or NFTs that grant access to their private group chats, they can create an additional revenue stream while giving fans and followers a sense of exclusivity.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Benefits</strong>: Fans get special access to behind-the-scenes content, exclusive Q&amp;As, or direct interactions with their favorite creators, while creators benefit from new revenue models.</li>
<li><strong>Use Case</strong>: A crypto influencer might create a token-gated chat for subscribers who hold a specific NFT, offering them VIP content and advice.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="how-hats-protocol-enhances-token-gated-group-chats"><strong>How Hats Protocol Enhances Token-Gated Group Chats</strong><a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-939/blog/token-gated-group-chats#how-hats-protocol-enhances-token-gated-group-chats" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to how-hats-protocol-enhances-token-gated-group-chats" title="Direct link to how-hats-protocol-enhances-token-gated-group-chats">​</a></h3>
<p>For DAOs using <strong>Hats Protocol</strong>, the integration of token-gated group chats can significantly streamline their communication processes. Hats Protocol enables the decentralized management of roles and permissions within a DAO, allowing members to be assigned "hats" based on their roles. These hats can also serve as access tokens for group chats, ensuring that only members with the relevant responsibilities can participate in specific discussions.</p>
<p>Here’s how DAOs that use Hats Protocol can benefit from token-gated group chats:</p>
<p><strong>1. Role-Based Chat Access:</strong></p>
<p>Hats Protocol allows DAOs to assign roles on-chain, ensuring that only those members who wear specific hats (such as "Treasury Manager" or "Governance Lead") have access to relevant group chats. This integration ensures that discussions stay focused and are only open to those with the proper permissions.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Benefits</strong>: Only relevant DAO members can join key discussions, preventing unqualified members from cluttering important communication channels.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Dynamic Access Control:</strong></p>
<p>As roles (or hats) within a DAO evolve, access to token-gated chats can dynamically adjust. When someone is promoted, or steps down from a role, their access to group chats is automatically updated, ensuring up-to-date permissions.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Benefits</strong>: Access to crucial communication channels remains in sync with the current organizational structure without manual updates.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Increased Security and Confidentiality:</strong></p>
<p>DAOs can maintain security and confidentiality by ensuring that sensitive topics, such as treasury or governance discussions, are restricted to verified role-holders. Hats Protocol makes it easy to manage and track who holds each hat, ensuring secure communication.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Benefits</strong>: Only authorized members access sensitive information, reducing the likelihood of leaks or mismanagement.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Streamlined Team Coordination:</strong></p>
<p>Large DAOs can have multiple teams managing different parts of the organization. Hats Protocol ensures that team members with the relevant roles can communicate within private, token-gated group chats, enhancing collaboration across decentralized teams.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Benefits</strong>: Teams can focus on their responsibilities, while DAO leaders can rest assured that only the right people can access certain discussions.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="the-future-of-token-gated-group-chats"><strong>The Future of Token-Gated Group Chats</strong><a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-939/blog/token-gated-group-chats#the-future-of-token-gated-group-chats" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to the-future-of-token-gated-group-chats" title="Direct link to the-future-of-token-gated-group-chats">​</a></h3>
<p>Token-gated chats are just one example of how Push Protocol is transforming the way we interact online. As the demand for decentralized governance, privacy, and exclusivity grows, token-gated communities will become a staple in the web3 ecosystem.</p>
<p>For DAOs, NFT collectors, on-chain role holders, and content creators alike, token-gated chats provide the tools needed to foster loyalty, increase engagement, and ensure that only the right people are involved in key discussions.</p>
<p>Token-gated group chats are unlocking a future where participation is open and earned, making the web3 ecosystem more exclusive, secure, and rewarding.</p>

<p>We’re thrilled to share that contributors at <a href="https://cartesi.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cartesi</a> have created an integration template for developers to be able to also leverage web3-native communications for DApp builders on Cartesi.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="what-is-cartesi"><strong>What is Cartesi?</strong><a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-939/blog/how-developers-can-integrate-cartesi-and-push-protocol#what-is-cartesi" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to what-is-cartesi" title="Direct link to what-is-cartesi">​</a></h3>
<p>Cartesi is an innovative modular blockchain protocol that empowers developers by providing a complete Linux environment along with high-performance rollups. This combination is designed to facilitate the development of advanced next-generation DApps. With it, decentralized applications should be easier, faster, and more scalable than ever before.</p>
<p>Cartesi overcomes the constraints of traditional blockchains by providing developers with a complete Linux operating system and scalable rollups, tailored for real-world applications. This opens up exciting new possibilities for DApps in gaming, DeFi, and other cutting-edge industries, unlocking the future of innovation.</p>
<p>Cartesi-built projects have consistently excelled in <a href="https://ethglobal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ETHGlobal</a> hackathons with innovative projects like <a href="https://ethglobal.com/showcase/cartenix-7xxe6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cartenix</a>, <a href="https://ethglobal.com/showcase/doom-arena-hmu4j" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Doom Arena</a>, and <a href="https://ethglobal.com/showcase/chaingpt-and-accountability-for-ai-agents-doquk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ChainGPT</a> gaining considerable traction. These projects not only showcase their commitment to decentralized computation but also highlight Cartesi’s unique ability to unlock new possibilities for scalable, high-performance DApps across various real-world use cases. Other Cartesi Mainnet DApps like <a href="https://rives.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rives</a> and <a href="https://bugbuster.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bug Buster</a> also showed new unforeseen possibilities.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="how-developers-can-integrate-cartesi-and-push-protocol">How Developers can Integrate Cartesi and Push Protocol:<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-939/blog/how-developers-can-integrate-cartesi-and-push-protocol#how-developers-can-integrate-cartesi-and-push-protocol" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How Developers can Integrate Cartesi and Push Protocol:" title="Direct link to How Developers can Integrate Cartesi and Push Protocol:">​</a></h3>
<p>Developer advocacy contributors at Cartesi have demonstrated how developers can integrate push notifications into their Cartesi dApps, enabling users to receive updates related to their activities within the Cartesi rollups environment. Developers can deliver finalized on-chain messages or simple in-app notifications that users care about.</p>
<p>This integration enhances the interactivity of Cartesi DApps, so users can receive timely updates—whether for verified outputs or simple messages—without monitoring epoch finalization.</p>
<p>This is particularly useful when managing on-chain assets, where users need to execute a voucher once an epoch is finalized. Vouchers serve as transaction instruments on the base layer blockchain, facilitating operations like asset transfers. They enable modifications to the base layer by reflecting the application's state changes. Read <a href="https://docs.cartesi.io/cartesi-rollups/1.5/development/retrieve-outputs/#vouchers-on-chain-actions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> to learn more about vouchers. With notifications powered by Push, Cartesi users can also stay informed about unexecuted vouchers, ensuring they don't miss critical updates, like withdrawing assets.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="technical-deep-dive-the-cartesi-push-notification-server"><strong>Technical Deep Dive: The Cartesi Push Notification Server</strong><a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-939/blog/how-developers-can-integrate-cartesi-and-push-protocol#technical-deep-dive-the-cartesi-push-notification-server" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to technical-deep-dive-the-cartesi-push-notification-server" title="Direct link to technical-deep-dive-the-cartesi-push-notification-server">​</a></h3>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/Mugen-Builders/push-cartesi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cartesi Push Notification Server</a> is a crucial tool that enhances the user experience of Cartesi DApps by providing real-time push notifications. This service is powered by a simple cron job that allows Cartesi DApp creators to notify users of important events, such as those mentioned above, verified outputs, or the availability of vouchers for asset withdrawal, without requiring users to monitor blockchain events like epoch finalization manually.</p>
<p><strong>Addressing the On-Chain Asset Challenge:</strong>
One key challenge in decentralized applications involving on-chain assets is the need for users to execute a voucher after an epoch has been finalized. Without notifications, users may miss the execution of vouchers, potentially delaying their withdrawal of assets. The Cartesi Push Notification Server directly solves this problem by alerting users when important events—such as unexecuted vouchers—occur, ensuring they remain informed and can act promptly in response to them.</p>
<p><strong>How It Works: Push Notifications for Cartesi DApps:</strong></p>
<p>The Push Cartesi Notification server operates through a cron job that regularly queries the Graphql server of the Cartesi dApp node to check for new or verified outputs. Here’s how developers can implement it:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Push Notification Architecture:</strong>
The Push Cartesi Notification Server leverages a cron job that filters for <a href="https://docs.cartesi.io/cartesi-rollups/1.5/development/retrieve-outputs/#notices-off-chain-events" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">notices</a> and verified proofs, sending timely notifications to users about these critical outputs. However, vouchers are intentionally excluded from the cron job, as they are deleted after execution. Instead, the system focuses on notifying users when a proof is available—triggering them to take action, such as executing a voucher.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here’s the architecture of how the Push Cartesi Notification Server works:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Push Cartesi Notification Server" src="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-939/assets/images/cover-image1-1a2d7a2eef09d0312d47790fdc03c045.webp" width="1340" height="746" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p><strong>Creating a Push Notification Channel:</strong>
To start, developers must set up a Push notification channel using <a href="https://push.org/docs/notifications/tutorials/create-your-channel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Push Protocol’s official guide</a>. The rest of the setup process is explained below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Efficient Notification Management Using Notices:</strong>
Developers can include a "notice" alongside vouchers to ensure users are properly informed about important, on-chain events. For example, when an NFT is minted, a notice can be generated to notify the user of this event, while the voucher handles the asset’s actual minting process. A notice is a verifiable data statement that confirms off-chain events or conditions, supported by accompanying proof.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Two Types of Notifications: Instant vs. Proofed:</strong>
Developers have control over when notifications are sent to users through two types of notices:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Instant Notifications: These notifications are sent immediately after a notice is created, allowing users to get real-time updates.</li>
<li>Proofed Notifications: These notifications are sent only when a proof is available, i.e., when the epoch finalizes, ensuring that users are alerted once the output is verified and actionable.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Streamlined Asset Withdrawals:</strong>
The Push/Cartesi notification system is particularly valuable in managing on-chain assets. When users need to withdraw assets, they are alerted when a voucher is ready for execution. By receiving these timely notifications, users can act quickly, avoiding delays or missed withdrawals.</li>
</ol>

<p>Disclaimer: <em>This integration is currently in its alpha stage and relies on certain trust assumptions regarding the Notifications server. Developers are encouraged to use this as an experimental step for integrating push notifications but should not consider it a final, mainnet-ready solution.</em></p>
<p>First, make sure you have created a channel for Push. Once you’ve done so, continue with the below steps to build and run the Notifications server with a sample Cartesi dApp on your local machine.:</p>
