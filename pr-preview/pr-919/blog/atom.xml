        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Cover image of How Push Chat is Different from Traditional Chat Platforms" src="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-919/assets/images/cover-image-5f71ebf14c55e14664855997b359f4d7.webp" width="1280" height="720" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>As the digital landscape shifts toward further decentralization, users' expectations around privacy, control, and engagement in their favorite chat platforms are evolving too.  <a href="https://push.org/docs/chat/#:~:text=Push%20Chat%20is%20a%20web3,numbers%2C%20email%20addresses%2C%20etc." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Push Chat</a>, the communication protocol of Web3 reimagines digital messaging by incorporating new technologies, improved UX, and user-first functionalities that traditional platforms like WhatsApp, Telegram, and Signal lack.</p>
<p>In this article, we dig deeper into what sets Push Chat apart.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="privacyanonymity-no-phone-number-or-email-required">Privacy+Anonymity: No Phone Number or Email Required<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-919/blog/how-push-chat-is-different-from-traditional-chat-platforms#privacyanonymity-no-phone-number-or-email-required" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Privacy+Anonymity: No Phone Number or Email Required" title="Direct link to Privacy+Anonymity: No Phone Number or Email Required">​</a></h3>
<p>Traditional chat apps like WhatsApp and Telegram require a phone number or email to register, tying users to a specific identity, which can expose them to data tracking, phishing, or unwanted contacts. Push Chat bypasses this entirely. Users only need a <a href="https://push.org/docs/notifications/supported-wallet-standards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">compatible EVM wallet</a> to connect, meaning they can remain anonymous and communicate securely without compromising their identity while keeping personal data decentralized and user-controlled.</p>
<p>Unlike centralized platforms that store personal information on servers, Push Chat’s decentralized model gives users complete control over their data, removing the risk of centralized data leaks or misuse.</p>
<p>This approach aligns with the principles of decentralization, where privacy and ownership of data are prioritized, giving users a significant advantage over conventional platforms.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="spam-prevention-with-opt-in-chats">Spam Prevention with Opt-In Chats<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-919/blog/how-push-chat-is-different-from-traditional-chat-platforms#spam-prevention-with-opt-in-chats" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Spam Prevention with Opt-In Chats" title="Direct link to Spam Prevention with Opt-In Chats">​</a></h3>
<p>Spam and unwanted messages are a common issue in traditional platforms. Push Chat employs a unique approach: it requires users to accept a request to chat before any conversation begins. This built-in spam filter means users won’t receive unsolicited messages unless they’ve approved the contact, making for a more streamlined and distraction-free experience.</p>
<p>Traditional platforms often struggle with managing unsolicited contacts, relying heavily on manual blocking or report mechanisms, whereas Push Chat’s solution is proactive and user-friendly.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="public-key-cryptographypkc-for-message-encryption">Public Key Cryptography(PKC) for Message Encryption<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-919/blog/how-push-chat-is-different-from-traditional-chat-platforms#public-key-cryptographypkc-for-message-encryption" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Public Key Cryptography(PKC) for Message Encryption" title="Direct link to Public Key Cryptography(PKC) for Message Encryption">​</a></h3>
<p>Privacy-conscious users will appreciate that Push Chat ensures end-to-end encryption for all of its users. Although some traditional platforms like WhatsApp also provide this feature, Push Chat takes it a step further by using cryptography to ensure that messages remain private and can only be decrypted by the intended recipient.</p>
<p>When a user registers with Push Chat using their wallet, a public-private key pair is generated for them. The private key remains stored in the user’s wallet, while the public key is available for others to encrypt messages intended for that user. When User A sends a message to User B, Push Chat uses User B’s public key to encrypt the message. This ensures that only someone with the corresponding private key (User B) can decrypt and read it.</p>
<p>This encryption is achieved through asymmetric cryptography, a standard cryptographic technique where public keys are used to encrypt data and private keys to decrypt it. This setup makes it difficult for third parties to intercept messages, ensuring only the sender and recipient can read their conversations.</p>
<p>In summary, <a href="https://push.org/docs/chat/concepts/encryption-version-in-push-chat/#:~:text=Encryption%20in%20Push%20Chat,or%20decrypt%20your%20PGP%20keys" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Push Chat’s end-to-end encryption</a> leverages advanced cryptographic standards, entirely decentralized public-key management, and blockchain-based verification to ensure messages remain private, authenticated, and secure across the network.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="enhanced-interactivity-with-farcaster-frames-support">Enhanced Interactivity with Farcaster Frames Support<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-919/blog/how-push-chat-is-different-from-traditional-chat-platforms#enhanced-interactivity-with-farcaster-frames-support" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Enhanced Interactivity with Farcaster Frames Support" title="Direct link to Enhanced Interactivity with Farcaster Frames Support">​</a></h3>

<li>Allowing Frames developers to build gamified, rich apps with user contexts, enabling powerful utilities and actions.</li>
<li>Letting users directly use their products without having to leave the Push Chat client.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a significant leap from the static nature of most traditional chats, where content is limited to media and text. With Farcaster Frames, Push Chat allows users to embed interactive experiences, making discussions more vibrant and personalized.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="enhanced-security-through-decentralized-infrastructure"><strong>Enhanced Security Through Decentralized Infrastructure</strong><a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-919/blog/how-push-chat-is-different-from-traditional-chat-platforms#enhanced-security-through-decentralized-infrastructure" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to enhanced-security-through-decentralized-infrastructure" title="Direct link to enhanced-security-through-decentralized-infrastructure">​</a></h3>
<p>Push Chat’s architecture is fundamentally decentralized, leveraging blockchain technology to enhance security and privacy. Messages are stored on IPFS, ensuring that data remains accessible yet tamper-proof, without relying on any central server. Traditional messaging platforms often store data on centralized servers, which act as single points of failure and make data more vulnerable to breaches. In contrast, Push Chat’s decentralized infrastructure minimizes these risks, ensuring that data remains secure and user-controlled. Additionally, all messages are validated by decentralized nodes in the Push Network, which verify sender authenticity and ensure the message integrity that centralized platforms can’t match. This decentralized setup gives users control over their data, with each message transaction backed by blockchain-grade security.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="its-ecosystem-integration-potential"><strong>Its Ecosystem Integration Potential</strong><a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-919/blog/how-push-chat-is-different-from-traditional-chat-platforms#its-ecosystem-integration-potential" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to its-ecosystem-integration-potential" title="Direct link to its-ecosystem-integration-potential">​</a></h3>
<p>Push Chat is designed with <a href="https://push.org/docs/chat/ui-components/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">seamless Web3-based integration</a> in mind, allowing it to be embedded directly within dApps across various ecosystems, from DeFi and DAOs to NFT platforms through its SDK.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What is Decentralized Social Media and Why Does it Matter?]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Cover Image of What is Decentralized Social Media and Why Does it Matter?" src="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-919/assets/images/cover-image-cc72de1f1ec0eb6feaeeb4d0bce09d00.webp" width="1920" height="1080" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>In today's world, social media is one of the most important ways we connect, share, and express ourselves. Centralized platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram have, to date, dominated the landscape. However, they come with significant drawbacks: they control user data, moderate content arbitrarily, and are driven by algorithms that prioritize selective monetization over genuine interaction.</p>
<p>Decentralized social media marks a pivotal shift in how we engage in our favorite spaces online. It's not just a fleeting trend—it's a movement poised to redefine online interactions, ownership, and privacy. By offering an alternative to the status quo, decentralized social media empowers users with unprecedented control over their data, social connections, and digital identities. This article will explore what decentralized social media is, its significance, and how innovative platforms such as Farcaster, Lens Protocol, Cyber, and Push Protocol are spearheading this transformation.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="verifiable-data-ownership-and-better-privacy"><strong>Verifiable Data Ownership and Better Privacy</strong><a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-919/blog/what-is-decentralized-social-media#verifiable-data-ownership-and-better-privacy" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to verifiable-data-ownership-and-better-privacy" title="Direct link to verifiable-data-ownership-and-better-privacy">​</a></h2>
<p>A crucial difference between centralized and decentralized social media is their approach to data ownership. On traditional platforms like Facebook, Instagram, or X (formerly Twitter), users relinquish control of their data from the moment they sign up. Every post, comment, like, and share is stored on company-owned servers and used to serve ads or fine-tune engagement algorithms. Users have little to no say in how their data is used, sold, or manipulated.</p>
<p>At its core, decentralized social media empowers users by giving them back control over their data. By utilizing blockchain technology, decentralized social platforms ensure that users retain control over their personal information and interactions. No single entity has the power to censor, delete, or exploit this data without the user's consent. This shift from platform-owned to user-owned data is a crucial step toward building a more open, transparent, and privacy-respecting social media landscape. This shift is already underway, as evidenced by the examples we'll explore below.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="composable--decentralized-social-graphs-lens-protocol"><strong>Composable &amp; Decentralized Social Graphs: Lens Protocol</strong><a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-919/blog/what-is-decentralized-social-media#composable--decentralized-social-graphs-lens-protocol" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to composable--decentralized-social-graphs-lens-protocol" title="Direct link to composable--decentralized-social-graphs-lens-protocol">​</a></h2>
<p>A key innovation of decentralized social media is the concept of composable social graphs. On traditional platforms, a user's social graph (their collection of connections, followers, and interactions) is locked away by the provider. If said user wants to switch to a new platform, they lose access to all of the relationships they’ve built and the content they may have curated or created. On decentralized platforms, your social graph—your relationships, posts, and interactions—can be seamlessly transferred across any app supporting the same protocol.</p>
<p>Lens Protocol is a prime example of how decentralized social media can empower users to take full ownership of their online identity and social graph. Built on Polygon, Lens offers users composable profiles that can interact with a variety of social dApps supported by its foundational network. No matter what dApp they use to choose, Lens users truly own their social graph as an NFT. This means that it is always possible to move between different dApps (decentralized applications) without having to rebuild their audience or connections. This level of portability is made possible through blockchain technology, fostering a more interoperable and user-friendly decentralized social ecosystem.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="dynamic-social-engagement-farcaster-frames"><strong>Dynamic Social Engagement: Farcaster Frames</strong><a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-919/blog/what-is-decentralized-social-media#dynamic-social-engagement-farcaster-frames" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to dynamic-social-engagement-farcaster-frames" title="Direct link to dynamic-social-engagement-farcaster-frames">​</a></h2>
<p>Farcaster via its primary client, Warpcast, illustrates how decentralized social media can be more engaging and empowering for users. They not only allow users to own their social graph and content but also introduce a novel feature called "Frames,” which we’re integrating <a href="https://gov.push.org/t/bringing-frames-interactive-mini-apps-to-push-network/1659" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">into the Push Protocol ecosystem</a>.</p>
<p>Frames are interactive, modular spaces within posts (known as "Casts" on Farcaster via Warpcast) where users can embed dynamic content such as polls, live updates, or even full-scale applications.</p>
<p>The launch of Frames has already enabled entirely new forms of interaction and engagement that go beyond what was possible before. Web-based content goes from its current, fairly static state to the equivalent of an application in and of itself. What about literal instant check-out for orders? Imagine being able to vote on a DAO proposal, stream a podcast, trade crypto or NFTs, and subscribe to a creator or channel—all within the same post. That’s a kind of composability that centralized platforms simply can’t match. By allowing users to organize and showcase the content they find most meaningful, Frames create a more personalized and context-driven experience. Though it’s early, Frames are already a key cog in the machine that represents the future of all social media.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="an-improved-streamlined-user-experience-cyber"><strong>An Improved, Streamlined User Experience: Cyber</strong><a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-919/blog/what-is-decentralized-social-media#an-improved-streamlined-user-experience-cyber" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to an-improved-streamlined-user-experience-cyber" title="Direct link to an-improved-streamlined-user-experience-cyber">​</a></h2>
<p>Cyber, a Layer 2 solution built on Optimism's Superchain and hyper-optimized for web3 social interactions aims to a user experience on par with apps that are already household names on the legacy web. It achieves this by addressing key usability challenges and boosting the scalability and performance of decentralized platforms.</p>
<p>Traditional blockchain platforms can also be clunky for users unfamiliar with managing private keys, wallets, and on-chain transactions. Cyber addresses this by incorporating built-in account abstraction and seedless wallets, delivering a frictionless user experience. Account abstraction simplifies wallet management by abstracting the complexities of managing multiple accounts and private keys away from the user. Seedless wallets, on the other hand, eliminate the need for cumbersome recovery phrases. Together, these features allow users to interact with decentralized apps and platforms as easily as they would with centralized services—without compromising security or ownership.</p>
<p>As social interactions become more complex and require faster processing times, Layer 2 solutions like Cyber will become increasingly important for both developers and users.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="decentralized-cross-chain-communication-push"><strong>Decentralized Cross-Chain Communication: Push</strong><a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-919/blog/what-is-decentralized-social-media#decentralized-cross-chain-communication-push" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to decentralized-cross-chain-communication-push" title="Direct link to decentralized-cross-chain-communication-push">​</a></h2>
<p>Platforms like <strong>Push Protocol</strong>, with its <strong>Push Chat</strong> feature, add a layer of utility by offering decentralized messaging systems. Unlike traditional messaging platforms, Push Chat enables encrypted, peer-to-peer communication, where users retain complete control over their conversations. The integration of notifications is another major win—decentralized push notifications ensure users stay updated on critical events, such as governance proposals, NFT drops, or community votes, all without relying on centralized servers.</p>
<p>Soon to be <a href="https://www.notion.so/Abstracting-away-Chains-for-a-better-UX-5fc5796918aa47ed8619a72d3bd01af9?pvs=21" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cross-chain</a>, Push Chat will allow users to communicate across multiple blockchain networks, making it a powerful tool for decentralized communication and breaking down the silos between separate ecosystems. By enabling cross-chain communication, Push Chat opens up seamless interaction for users in decentralized communities, governance, and beyond.</p>
<p>Whether it's notifying users of governance proposals, sending updates on decentralized projects, <a href="https://push.org/blog/hyper-scalable-group-chats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">facilitating hyper-scalable group chats</a>, or supporting the future of comms, social, gaming, and generally innovative apps through its grants program, Push is setting a new standard for decentralized communication tools and applications.</p>
<p>As Push Chat and Push Protocol itself continue to evolve, they will become even more important for decentralized social networks, since together, they allow users to communicate seamlessly across different dApps and ecosystems.&nbsp; Cross-chain functionality is a game-changer for both social interaction and decentralized governance, as it breaks down the barriers between blockchain networks. Push’s commitment to <a href="https://push.org/blog/cross-chain-requests-pre-pip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">enabling Cross-Chain Requests</a> demonstrates the team’s commitment to being a forerunner in that respect.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="the-future-of-social-media-is-coming"><strong>The Future of Social Media is Coming</strong><a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-919/blog/what-is-decentralized-social-media#the-future-of-social-media-is-coming" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to the-future-of-social-media-is-coming" title="Direct link to the-future-of-social-media-is-coming">​</a></h2>
<p>Decentralized social media offers a transformative approach to how we interact online, empowering users with ownership of their data, social graphs, and communication channels. Ultimately, decentralized social media is about more than just freedom from centralized control—it’s about creating a fairer, more user-centric web. By embracing decentralized platforms, we can take back control of our online identities and interactions. We will also be able to explore new models of engagement that are transparent, innovative, and built for the benefit of the user, not the platform.</p>
<p>This shift is not just inevitable; it’s necessary.</p>
<p>As we become more aware of the limitations and risks of centralized social networks, the move toward decentralized alternatives will accelerate. More users, developers, and creators will flock to platforms like <strong>Farcaster</strong>, <strong>Lens</strong>, <strong>Cyber</strong>, and <strong>Push Protocol</strong>. We’ll begin to see a new era of online interaction—one that puts users at the center of everything and further connects our nascent industry, building a better, more equitable internet for all.</p>
<p>All of the frameworks, networks, and projects mentioned here are key partners of Push Protocol and its DAO. Inside Push DAO, we believe that together with these groups and all of Push’s partners, we’ll build a truly impactful future for online communication and the internet at large.</p>
<p>Together, we'll make web3 the prevailing reality.</p>
<p><a href="https://gov.push.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reach out to the DAO</a> and we’ll get you plugged in with the ecosystem’s grants program, which is now undergoing an exciting evolution in preparation for 2025.

<p>In the fast-moving Web3 space, new developments and breakthroughs emerge at breakneck speeds, so staying informed and ahead of the curve is essential. However, most decentralized applications (dApps) lack native notification systems, leaving users in the dark when critical on-chain events occur. This is where push notifications, an on-chain communications primitive developed by Push Protocol, become crucial.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="dapps-lack-native-notifications"><strong>dApps Lack Native Notifications</strong><a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-919/blog/why-onchain-push-notifications-matter#dapps-lack-native-notifications" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to dapps-lack-native-notifications" title="Direct link to dapps-lack-native-notifications">​</a></h2>
<p>Most Web3 applications operate in a decentralized manner. They often don't include native push notifications like their Web2 counterparts (aka notifications you would receive from apps like WhatsApp or X). In the case of traditional apps, push notifications keep users updated on essential activities—whether it's a message from a friend or a reminder to pay bills. dApps, by contrast, typically require users to manually check their wallets or dashboards for updates, creating a less-than-user-friendly experience.</p>
<p>Without notifications, users can easily miss key events like:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Price movements of their favorite assets</strong></li>
<li><strong>Governance proposal updates in DAOs</strong></li>
<li><strong>Liquidation alerts in DeFi platforms</strong></li>
<li><strong>The latest publications from their chosen web3 news platform</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This gap is more than a mere inconvenience; it affects user engagement, asset security, and decision-making.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Cover image of Abstracting away Chains for a better DApp UX" src="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-919/assets/images/cover-image-69507d49894f5d9f0d44b5a6f5fd2ec5.webp" width="1600" height="900" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>In the rapidly evolving landscape of Web3, user experience (UX) remains a pivotal factor in driving adoption and sustaining engagement.</p>
<p>One of the key innovations and the current <em>hot</em> narrative of web3 aiming to improve the overall UX of web3 apps is <strong>Chain Abstraction</strong>.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, Chain Abstraction aims to create a seamless and intuitive experience for users and developers, by simplifying interactions across multiple blockchain networks, bridging the gap between complex blockchain mechanics and everyday usability.</p>
<p>This article delves into the core concept of Chain Abstraction, explores its technical benefits, underscores its significance for the broader Web3 vision, and highlights what we at Push are doing to improve the UX of our applications.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="first-lets-understand-chain-abstraction">First, Let’s Understand Chain Abstraction<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-919/blog/abstracting-chains-for-better-dapp-ux#first-lets-understand-chain-abstraction" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to First, Let’s Understand Chain Abstraction" title="Direct link to First, Let’s Understand Chain Abstraction">​</a></h2>
<p><strong>Chain Abstraction</strong> refers to the combined effort of hiding the complexities associated with interacting with multiple blockchain networks, allowing users and developers to engage with decentralized applications (dApps) without needing to manage the intricacies of each underlying chain. Essentially, it acts as an intermediary layer that simplifies cross-chain interactions, enabling seamless communication and functionality across diverse blockchain ecosystems.</p>
<p>The fundamental idea behind Chain Abstraction is to create a unified user experience that abstracts away the differences between various blockchain protocols.</p>
<p>This means that users can perform actions on a dApp without having to switch networks, manage multiple wallets, or understand the technical nuances of each blockchain. By streamlining these interactions, Chain Abstraction aims to make Web3 more accessible and user-friendly, fostering broader adoption and sustained engagement.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="enhancing-web3-dapp-ux-through-chain-abstraction">Enhancing Web3 dApp UX Through Chain Abstraction<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-919/blog/abstracting-chains-for-better-dapp-ux#enhancing-web3-dapp-ux-through-chain-abstraction" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Enhancing Web3 dApp UX Through Chain Abstraction" title="Direct link to Enhancing Web3 dApp UX Through Chain Abstraction">​</a></h2>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="simplified-user-interactions">Simplified User Interactions<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-919/blog/abstracting-chains-for-better-dapp-ux#simplified-user-interactions" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Simplified User Interactions" title="Direct link to Simplified User Interactions">​</a></h3>
<p>One of the primary benefits of Chain Abstraction is the simplification of user interactions with dApps. Currently, users often need to switch between different blockchain networks to access various functionalities, which can be cumbersome and deter non-technical users.</p>
<p>Here is a quick glance at what the typical web3 user needs to deal with today in this multi-chain web3 ecosystem:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>managing multiple wallets,</em></li>
<li><em>managing multiple native tokens/assets in their multiple wallets,</em></li>
<li><em>understanding the nuances of each network,</em></li>
<li><em>navigating multiple networks to perform simple tasks,</em></li>
<li><em>interacting with complicated dApp UIs with frequent network switching,</em></li>
<li><em>navigate through inconsistent user interfaces,</em></li>
<li><em>relying on the risky route of cross-chain bridging between chains,</em></li>
<li><em>experiencing difficulty in maintaining a consistent cross-chain identity due to the multi-chain ecosystem,</em></li>
<li><em>dealing with the lack of standardization between networks, protocols, etc.</em></li>
<li><em>dealing with the learning curve of understanding different networks, each with its own set of rules, interfaces, and requirements.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Remember that this is just a glance at the UX problem. There are undoubtedly more issues that an experienced web3 user faces daily. The list is even longer when it comes to newbie web3 users.</p>
<p>However, with Chain Abstraction, most of it gets abstracted away.</p>
<p>In other words, chain abstraction shall allow users to only perform the bare minimum actions and delegate all others to specialized on-chain or off-chain actors. These actors can simply take the user’s intent and themselves figure out the best route, chain, transaction order, etc to fulfill the user’s request.</p>
<p>This means that the user can have a significantly simplified on-chain interaction where most of the multi-chain-specific complicated tasks will be abstracted away from them, thus improving the overall UX for an average Joe.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="unified-wallet-management">Unified Wallet Management<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-919/blog/abstracting-chains-for-better-dapp-ux#unified-wallet-management" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Unified Wallet Management" title="Direct link to Unified Wallet Management">​</a></h3>
<p>Managing multiple wallets across different chains is another pain point for users.</p>
<p>Chain Abstraction addresses this by enabling a single wallet interface that can interact with multiple blockchains. This reduces the cognitive load on users, allowing them to manage their digital assets more efficiently as well as more securely from a single platform.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="seamless-cross-chain-transactions">Seamless Cross-Chain Transactions<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-919/blog/abstracting-chains-for-better-dapp-ux#seamless-cross-chain-transactions" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Seamless Cross-Chain Transactions" title="Direct link to Seamless Cross-Chain Transactions">​</a></h3>
<p>Chain Abstraction facilitates seamless cross-chain transactions, eliminating the need for manual bridging or swapping of assets. This not only enhances the speed and efficiency of transactions but also reduces the risk of errors and the potential security vulnerabilities associated with manual bridging processes.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="enhanced-performance-and-scalability">Enhanced Performance and Scalability<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-919/blog/abstracting-chains-for-better-dapp-ux#enhanced-performance-and-scalability" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Enhanced Performance and Scalability" title="Direct link to Enhanced Performance and Scalability">​</a></h3>
<p>Chain Abstraction can also contribute to improved performance and scalability of dApps. By leveraging the strengths of multiple blockchains, dApps can optimize transaction speeds and reduce congestion on any single network.</p>
<p>This distributed approach ensures that dApps remain responsive and efficient, even as user demand grows.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="security-and-reliability">Security and Reliability<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-919/blog/abstracting-chains-for-better-dapp-ux#security-and-reliability" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Security and Reliability" title="Direct link to Security and Reliability">​</a></h3>
<p>While traditional interop or bridging solutions often introduce multiple points of vulnerability. For instance, the reliance on centralized validators or relayers can lead to potential breaches if these entities are compromised. Additionally, bridges typically depend on complex smart contracts and multi-signature schemes, which, if not meticulously audited, become prime targets for attackers. Historical incidents have underscored these risks, with a substantial portion of stolen crypto funds originating from bridge exploits. Most of the <a href="https://medium.com/immunefi/common-cross-chain-bridge-vulnerabilities-d8c161ffaf8f" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">massive crypto hacks</a> in the past have occurred through compromised bridges, highlighting the critical need for more secure cross-chain solutions.</p>
<p>In contrast, Chain Abstraction minimizes these risks by shrinking down the attack surface area to a greater extent as it reduces direct user interactions with various chains. Instead of users navigating multiple networks and managing separate security protocols, Chain Abstraction delegates these responsibilities to specialized on-chain actors, such as intent handlers or solvers.</p>
<p>This delegation not only streamlines the user experience but also centralizes security oversight, allowing for more effective and consistent application of security measures. By handling transactions through a unified interface, Chain Abstraction can implement robust security protocols that ensure transactions are validated and processed securely across all supported chains.</p>
<p>However, it's important to recognize that Chain Abstraction introduces new points of security consideration. The addition of abstraction layers and off-chain components, like handlers or solvers, necessitates a reevaluation of the security framework. While these layers reduce the attack surface by limiting direct interactions with multiple chains, they also require their own stringent security measures. Ensuring the integrity and security of these new components is crucial, as any vulnerabilities within the abstraction layer could potentially compromise the entire system.</p>

<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="ccr-push-protocols-crucial-move-towards-enhancing-ux">CCR: Push Protocol’s Crucial Move towards Enhancing UX<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-919/blog/abstracting-chains-for-better-dapp-ux#ccr-push-protocols-crucial-move-towards-enhancing-ux" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to CCR: Push Protocol’s Crucial Move towards Enhancing UX" title="Direct link to CCR: Push Protocol’s Crucial Move towards Enhancing UX">​</a></h2>
<p>At Push Protocol, we have consistently focused on enhancing the user experience, not only for Push’s own community but also for the entire Web3 ecosystem.</p>
<p>Since the launch of our dApp, we have prioritized a <a href="https://push.org/blog/the-rise-of-chains-and-fall-of-ux-in-web3-ux/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UX-driven</a> and security-first strategy.</p>
<p>Whether we’re refining the visual interface, optimizing our smart contracts, or implementing gasless opt-ins for seamless dApp interactions, we remain dedicated to these principles across all facets of our platform.</p>
<p>However, improving UX in web3 involves far more than just building intuitive user interfaces for our applications.</p>
<p>In a multi-chain ecosystem, users have to deal with a lot more complexities, as previously mentioned in this article.</p>
<p>Since Push Protocol supports more than one EVM chain (<em>and soon will support non-evm chains),</em> our dApp’s UX needs to be improved accordingly.</p>
<p>There is a need for us to ensure we abstract away all the multi-chain complexity for our users and provide a single unified interface for them to use.</p>
<p>And, we do this with the <a href="https://gov.push.org/t/pre-pip-3-cross-chain-request-feature-in-push-smart-contracts-v3/1794" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Cross Chain Request Feature.</strong></a></p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="what-is-cross-chain-requests-ccr">What is Cross Chain Requests (CCR)?<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-919/blog/abstracting-chains-for-better-dapp-ux#what-is-cross-chain-requests-ccr" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is Cross Chain Requests (CCR)?" title="Direct link to What is Cross Chain Requests (CCR)?">​</a></h3>
<p><strong>Cross Chain Requests (CCR)</strong> is a feature recently proposed in <a href="https://gov.push.org/t/pre-pip-3-cross-chain-request-feature-in-push-smart-contracts-v3/1794" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Push Protocol’s Pre-PIP 3 governance proposal</a>. It aims to implement Cross Chain Requests within Push Protocol’s smart contracts, namely PushCore and PushComm.</p>
<p>The CCR feature allows users to interact with the PushCore smart contract deployed on the Ethereum chain from any EVM or Non-EVM chain without the need to switch networks. Thus, providing an abstracted experience.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="how-ccr-enhances-dapp-ux">How CCR Enhances dApp UX<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-919/blog/abstracting-chains-for-better-dapp-ux#how-ccr-enhances-dapp-ux" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How CCR Enhances dApp UX" title="Direct link to How CCR Enhances dApp UX">​</a></h3>
<p><strong>Seamless Network Interactions</strong></p>
<p>With CCR, users can perform essential actions such as <a href="https://app.push.org/channel/create" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">channel creation</a>, incentivized chat requests, and other arbitrary requests directly from their preferred blockchain. This eliminates the need to switch to Ethereum to interact with PushCore, thereby streamlining the user experience and reducing friction.</p>
<p><strong>Multi-Chain Compatibility</strong></p>
<p>CCR shall leverage <a href="https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/example-native-token-transfers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wormhole’s Native Token Transfer (NTT) architecture</a> and Relayers to enable secure cross-chain message and token bridging.</p>
<p>This allows PushComm contracts deployed on various chains to relay requests to PushCore on Ethereum securely.</p>
<p>Users can initiate actions from their native chains, enhancing the flexibility and convenience of interacting with Push Protocol.</p>
<p>By enabling seamless interactions from any chain, Push Protocol can attract users from various blockchain ecosystems. This broadens the platform’s user base, fostering a more interconnected and diverse community that benefits from enhanced interoperability.</p>
<p><strong>Simplified Channel Creation</strong></p>
<p>For instance, a user like Bob, who operates on Polygon, can create a channel on PushCore without leaving Polygon. By using PushComm’s <em>createChannel()</em> function, Bob can submit channel details and approve necessary tokens directly from Polygon. CCR ensures that the request is securely relayed to PushCore on Ethereum, where the channel is created without Bob needing to navigate complex cross-chain processes.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="technical-improvements-through-ccr">Technical Improvements Through CCR<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-919/blog/abstracting-chains-for-better-dapp-ux#technical-improvements-through-ccr" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Technical Improvements Through CCR" title="Direct link to Technical Improvements Through CCR">​</a></h3>

<p>CCR centralizes the interaction logic within PushComm contracts deployed on multiple chains, enabling them to handle cross-chain requests effectively. This reduces the architectural complexity and ensures that PushCore remains secure and efficient without needing multiple deployments across different chains.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="enhanced-security">Enhanced Security<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-919/blog/abstracting-chains-for-better-dapp-ux#enhanced-security" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Enhanced Security" title="Direct link to Enhanced Security">​</a></h3>
<p>By utilizing Wormhole’s NTT framework and Relayers, CCR ensures that cross-chain messages and token transfers are conducted securely.</p>
<p>This minimizes the risk of vulnerabilities and enhances the overall reliability of cross-chain interactions, fostering greater user trust in Push Protocol’s solutions.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="scalability-and-efficiency">Scalability and Efficiency<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-919/blog/abstracting-chains-for-better-dapp-ux#scalability-and-efficiency" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Scalability and Efficiency" title="Direct link to Scalability and Efficiency">​</a></h3>
<p>CCR allows Push Protocol to scale its operations across multiple chains without being limited by the constraints of a single blockchain.</p>
<p>This scalability ensures that Push Protocol can accommodate a growing user base and diverse application needs, driving sustained growth and adoption.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="chain-abstraction-where-were-headed">Chain Abstraction: Where We're Headed<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-919/blog/abstracting-chains-for-better-dapp-ux#chain-abstraction-where-were-headed" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Chain Abstraction: Where We're Headed" title="Direct link to Chain Abstraction: Where We're Headed">​</a></h2>

<p>Token-gated group chats are web3 native communication spaces where access is restricted based on the ownership of specific blockchain assets such as tokens or NFTs (non-fungible tokens). To put it even more simply, users must hold a certain token or NFT in their wallet to be granted entry to these exclusive group chats. This concept leverages the power of the different <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ERC token</a> standard technologies, offering decentralized and permissionless access control to on-chain communities.</p>
<p>These gated communities are becoming an increasingly popular option across all sorts of web3 groups, including DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations), NFT collector groups, and on-chain role holders. By tokenizing access, these chats provide a powerful tool for enhancing privacy, fostering trust, and building a strong sense of belonging.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="how-do-token-gated-group-chats-work"><strong>How Do Token-Gated Group Chats Work?</strong><a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-919/blog/token-gated-group-chats#how-do-token-gated-group-chats-work" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to how-do-token-gated-group-chats-work" title="Direct link to how-do-token-gated-group-chats-work">​</a></h3>
<p>First, token-gated chats depend on the accurate verification of the assets in a user’s blockchain wallet. In the case of Push’s gated chats, Push Protocol authenticates a user's wallet holdings to ensure they possess the required token or NFT to join the chat. The authentication is automatic, eliminating the need for traditional usernames, passwords, or email sign-ups. This process is seamless, privacy-focused, and ensures that only eligible users gain access to the chat or chats involved.</p>
<p>All of it is done in a matter of minutes.</p>
<p>Once authenticated, users can join discussions, receive exclusive content, participate in community governance, and more—making these group chats integral to any on-chain community.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="why-do-we-need-token-gated-group-chats"><strong>Why Do We Need Token-Gated Group Chats?</strong><a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-919/blog/token-gated-group-chats#why-do-we-need-token-gated-group-chats" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to why-do-we-need-token-gated-group-chats" title="Direct link to why-do-we-need-token-gated-group-chats">​</a></h3>
<p>The need for token-gated group chats stems from the growing demand for decentralized, transparent, and secure community management tools and workstreams in the web3 space.</p>
<p>Below, we’ve compiled several examples of current and future use cases:</p>
<p><strong>1. Exclusive Access for DAOs:</strong></p>
<p>For DAOs, token-gated group chats offer a mechanism to ensure that only voting members or contributors with skin in the game can participate in decision-making discussions. By using governance tokens as the entry key, DAOs can securely manage spaces where they want only a certain threshold of token holders to participate and share opinions.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Benefits</strong>: Having tokenized group chata strengthens governance processes by ensuring that only active, vested members are involved in the DAO's core operations, reducing noise and improving engagement quality.</li>
<li><strong>Use Case</strong>: DAOs like MakerDAO or Uniswap could create token-gated group chats for core governance contributors or voting members, creating secure spaces for key discussions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Community Building for NFT Collectors:</strong></p>
<p>NFT projects are built on the idea of exclusive ownership, and token-gated chats are a natural extension of this exclusivity. By allowing only verified NFT holders into private chat rooms, project creators can cultivate tight-knit communities that feel valued, special, and more closely connected to artists, founders, or whoever else the holders bought the NFT to support.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Benefits</strong>: NFT owners get a space where they can engage directly with creators and fellow collectors, access exclusive content, and receive early updates or airdrops.</li>
<li><strong>Use Case</strong>: A popular NFT collection like Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) might use a token-gated chat to offer holders access to exclusive discussions about future projects, merchandise drops, or events.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Enhanced Security and Privacy:</strong></p>
<p>Token-gated group chats inherently provide a higher level of privacy and security compared to traditional centralized platforms. By using cryptographic wallets as authentication, users no longer need to rely on third-party platforms that store personal data. This aligns with the ethos of decentralization and significantly reduces the risks of hacking or data breaches.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Benefits</strong>: No usernames or passwords or any storage of any sort of personal documents is required and there is no risk of sensitive personal information being leaked.</li>
<li><strong>Use Case</strong>: Communities concerned with privacy, like those focused on anonymous or pseudonymous interactions, can use token-gated chats to ensure secure and private communication.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Direct Monetization of Communities:</strong></p>
<p>For content creators and influencers, token-gated chats provide a unique opportunity to monetize access to their communities. By selling tokens or NFTs that grant access to their private group chats, they can create an additional revenue stream while giving fans and followers a sense of exclusivity.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Benefits</strong>: Fans get special access to behind-the-scenes content, exclusive Q&amp;As, or direct interactions with their favorite creators, while creators benefit from new revenue models.</li>
<li><strong>Use Case</strong>: A crypto influencer might create a token-gated chat for subscribers who hold a specific NFT, offering them VIP content and advice.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="how-hats-protocol-enhances-token-gated-group-chats"><strong>How Hats Protocol Enhances Token-Gated Group Chats</strong><a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-919/blog/token-gated-group-chats#how-hats-protocol-enhances-token-gated-group-chats" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to how-hats-protocol-enhances-token-gated-group-chats" title="Direct link to how-hats-protocol-enhances-token-gated-group-chats">​</a></h3>
<p>For DAOs using <strong>Hats Protocol</strong>, the integration of token-gated group chats can significantly streamline their communication processes. Hats Protocol enables the decentralized management of roles and permissions within a DAO, allowing members to be assigned "hats" based on their roles. These hats can also serve as access tokens for group chats, ensuring that only members with the relevant responsibilities can participate in specific discussions.</p>
<p>Here’s how DAOs that use Hats Protocol can benefit from token-gated group chats:</p>
<p><strong>1. Role-Based Chat Access:</strong></p>
<p>Hats Protocol allows DAOs to assign roles on-chain, ensuring that only those members who wear specific hats (such as "Treasury Manager" or "Governance Lead") have access to relevant group chats. This integration ensures that discussions stay focused and are only open to those with the proper permissions.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Benefits</strong>: Only relevant DAO members can join key discussions, preventing unqualified members from cluttering important communication channels.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Dynamic Access Control:</strong></p>
<p>As roles (or hats) within a DAO evolve, access to token-gated chats can dynamically adjust. When someone is promoted, or steps down from a role, their access to group chats is automatically updated, ensuring up-to-date permissions.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Benefits</strong>: Access to crucial communication channels remains in sync with the current organizational structure without manual updates.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Increased Security and Confidentiality:</strong></p>
<p>DAOs can maintain security and confidentiality by ensuring that sensitive topics, such as treasury or governance discussions, are restricted to verified role-holders. Hats Protocol makes it easy to manage and track who holds each hat, ensuring secure communication.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Benefits</strong>: Only authorized members access sensitive information, reducing the likelihood of leaks or mismanagement.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Streamlined Team Coordination:</strong></p>
<p>Large DAOs can have multiple teams managing different parts of the organization. Hats Protocol ensures that team members with the relevant roles can communicate within private, token-gated group chats, enhancing collaboration across decentralized teams.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Benefits</strong>: Teams can focus on their responsibilities, while DAO leaders can rest assured that only the right people can access certain discussions.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="the-future-of-token-gated-group-chats"><strong>The Future of Token-Gated Group Chats</strong><a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-919/blog/token-gated-group-chats#the-future-of-token-gated-group-chats" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to the-future-of-token-gated-group-chats" title="Direct link to the-future-of-token-gated-group-chats">​</a></h3>
<p>Token-gated chats are just one example of how Push Protocol is transforming the way we interact online. As the demand for decentralized governance, privacy, and exclusivity grows, token-gated communities will become a staple in the web3 ecosystem.</p>
<p>For DAOs, NFT collectors, on-chain role holders, and content creators alike, token-gated chats provide the tools needed to foster loyalty, increase engagement, and ensure that only the right people are involved in key discussions.</p>
<p>Token-gated group chats are unlocking a future where participation is open and earned, making the web3 ecosystem more exclusive, secure, and rewarding.</p>

<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="how-developers-can-integrate-cartesi-and-push-protocol">How Developers can Integrate Cartesi and Push Protocol:<a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-919/blog/how-developers-can-integrate-cartesi-and-push-protocol#how-developers-can-integrate-cartesi-and-push-protocol" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How Developers can Integrate Cartesi and Push Protocol:" title="Direct link to How Developers can Integrate Cartesi and Push Protocol:">​</a></h3>
<p>Developer advocacy contributors at Cartesi have demonstrated how developers can integrate push notifications into their Cartesi dApps, enabling users to receive updates related to their activities within the Cartesi rollups environment. Developers can deliver finalized on-chain messages or simple in-app notifications that users care about.</p>
<p>This integration enhances the interactivity of Cartesi DApps, so users can receive timely updates—whether for verified outputs or simple messages—without monitoring epoch finalization.</p>
<p>This is particularly useful when managing on-chain assets, where users need to execute a voucher once an epoch is finalized. Vouchers serve as transaction instruments on the base layer blockchain, facilitating operations like asset transfers. They enable modifications to the base layer by reflecting the application's state changes. Read <a href="https://docs.cartesi.io/cartesi-rollups/1.5/development/retrieve-outputs/#vouchers-on-chain-actions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> to learn more about vouchers. With notifications powered by Push, Cartesi users can also stay informed about unexecuted vouchers, ensuring they don't miss critical updates, like withdrawing assets.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="technical-deep-dive-the-cartesi-push-notification-server"><strong>Technical Deep Dive: The Cartesi Push Notification Server</strong><a href="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-919/blog/how-developers-can-integrate-cartesi-and-push-protocol#technical-deep-dive-the-cartesi-push-notification-server" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to technical-deep-dive-the-cartesi-push-notification-server" title="Direct link to technical-deep-dive-the-cartesi-push-notification-server">​</a></h3>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/Mugen-Builders/push-cartesi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cartesi Push Notification Server</a> is a crucial tool that enhances the user experience of Cartesi DApps by providing real-time push notifications. This service is powered by a simple cron job that allows Cartesi DApp creators to notify users of important events, such as those mentioned above, verified outputs, or the availability of vouchers for asset withdrawal, without requiring users to monitor blockchain events like epoch finalization manually.</p>
<p><strong>Addressing the On-Chain Asset Challenge:</strong>
One key challenge in decentralized applications involving on-chain assets is the need for users to execute a voucher after an epoch has been finalized. Without notifications, users may miss the execution of vouchers, potentially delaying their withdrawal of assets. The Cartesi Push Notification Server directly solves this problem by alerting users when important events—such as unexecuted vouchers—occur, ensuring they remain informed and can act promptly in response to them.</p>
<p><strong>How It Works: Push Notifications for Cartesi DApps:</strong></p>
<p>The Push Cartesi Notification server operates through a cron job that regularly queries the Graphql server of the Cartesi dApp node to check for new or verified outputs. Here’s how developers can implement it:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Push Notification Architecture:</strong>
The Push Cartesi Notification Server leverages a cron job that filters for <a href="https://docs.cartesi.io/cartesi-rollups/1.5/development/retrieve-outputs/#notices-off-chain-events" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">notices</a> and verified proofs, sending timely notifications to users about these critical outputs. However, vouchers are intentionally excluded from the cron job, as they are deleted after execution. Instead, the system focuses on notifying users when a proof is available—triggering them to take action, such as executing a voucher.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here’s the architecture of how the Push Cartesi Notification Server works:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Push Cartesi Notification Server" src="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-919/assets/images/cover-image1-1a2d7a2eef09d0312d47790fdc03c045.webp" width="1340" height="746" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p><strong>Creating a Push Notification Channel:</strong>
To start, developers must set up a Push notification channel using <a href="https://push.org/docs/notifications/tutorials/create-your-channel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Push Protocol’s official guide</a>. The rest of the setup process is explained below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Efficient Notification Management Using Notices:</strong>
Developers can include a "notice" alongside vouchers to ensure users are properly informed about important, on-chain events. For example, when an NFT is minted, a notice can be generated to notify the user of this event, while the voucher handles the asset’s actual minting process. A notice is a verifiable data statement that confirms off-chain events or conditions, supported by accompanying proof.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Two Types of Notifications: Instant vs. Proofed:</strong>
Developers have control over when notifications are sent to users through two types of notices:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Instant Notifications: These notifications are sent immediately after a notice is created, allowing users to get real-time updates.</li>
<li>Proofed Notifications: These notifications are sent only when a proof is available, i.e., when the epoch finalizes, ensuring that users are alerted once the output is verified and actionable.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Streamlined Asset Withdrawals:</strong>
The Push/Cartesi notification system is particularly valuable in managing on-chain assets. When users need to withdraw assets, they are alerted when a voucher is ready for execution. By receiving these timely notifications, users can act quickly, avoiding delays or missed withdrawals.</li>
</ol>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[ What is consumer crypto and why does it matter?]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Cover Image of What is consumer crypto and why does it matter?" src="https://push-protocol.github.io/push-website/pr-preview/pr-919/assets/images/cover-image-5c051971b8e8818cad8b2b87e99a3478.webp" width="1920" height="1080" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Bitcoin showed us that a decentralized monetary system can work in practice. Ethereum did the same for applications of all shapes and sizes. DeFi extended these principles, demonstrating a wide array of large-scale use cases for institutions and traders alike.</p>
<p>Now, as an industry, we’re on the precipice of our next major tipping point.</p>
<p>Consumer crypto.</p>
<p>It has exploded onto the scene over the past year and continues to dominate web3's zeitgeist. Conferences, podcasts, thought leaders, investors, and builders are all doubling down on its themes.</p>
<p>Major investors are prioritizing consumer crypto projects, particularly in social protocols, apps, and games, highlighting the industry's evolving focus and future direction.</p>
<p>Today, consumer crypto resembles the early days of online businesses during the dot-com boom. While many consumer-focused protocols and apps may be short-lived, a select few are poised to stand the test of time.</p>
<p>Currently, we're in the nascent stages of this boom.</p>
<p>Over the last 5 ETH Global hackathons, 80% of builders building with Push Protocol have chosen to ship projects focused on the consumer crypto niche. This is a major shift from 4 years ago when the same could be said for NFT marketplaces.</p>
<p>However, when you search “consumer crypto,” you get a wide variety of answers as to what it is, why it matters, and where it’s going.</p>
<p>There’s never been a better time than now to sift through the viewpoints and fully grok it.</p>
<p>In this post, we aim to:</p>
<p><em><strong>• Establish a clear definition of consumer crypto</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>• Explore the key reasons for its importance</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>• Comment on its future trajectory</strong></em></p>
<p>Industry professionals are thoroughly split on exactly how to define consumer crypto. Some suggest it all comes back to NFTs and their related token standards. Others say everything in the industry is moving towards consumer scale and has always been meant to go that route.</p>
<p>Others term it the movement focused on web3 apps that are purpose-built for everyday use by billions of people. While this is closer to the point, it doesn’t quite hit the nail on the head either.</p>
<p>Consumer crypto isn’t solely about web3 apps becoming household names.</p>
<p>It also refers to every layer of the stack being hyper-focused on providing novel experiences powered by the blockchain, smart contracts, tokenization, and everything in between. Zooming in, it could then be said that consumer crypto is the niche of the greater crypto industry that’s focused on building the future of all apps and services, powered by blockchain tech.</p>
<p>However, that’s still not quite it.</p>
<p>There’s something more that needs to be included because to scale all things crypto or more accurately, all things web3, to the masses, we need improvements to every level of the industry’s aggregated UX.</p>
<p>However, this concept needs to be simplified for the average person to grasp it. To establish a universal definition for consumer crypto, it's important to first identify and address what isn’t working.</p>
<p>Most consumers object to using crypto or anything related because they don’t see the need to switch to it. They return to the option they already trust and continue interacting within its walls.</p>
<p>This measure of how often users keep coming back to an app is called “stickiness,” and it’s something that web3 apps have yet to achieve on any comparable level to web2’s household names.</p>
<p>Think about why Slack is sticky, even for Web3 teams.</p>
<p>Once you pass a certain threshold of all-time messages sent, it becomes the standard for communication in your workplace. It doesn’t matter, in most cases, how many alternatives pop up. Your historical conversations and all the documents you’ve ever shared are stored in your team’s Slack.</p>
<p>What about Google Meet?</p>
<p>It’s a sticky progressive web app because it seamlessly integrates with your calendar and it just works. You can schedule a meeting in four clicks, counting inputting participating emails, and you don’t even have to have a Gmail to join one you’re invited to.</p>
<p>People keep coming back because, above all else, it’s intuitive to use and it doesn’t lock anyone out.</p>
<p>Consumer crypto, as a whole, is a vision to build out sticky apps that scale far beyond the web3 niche. All in all, the key goal is for them to be just as intuitive to use as their legacy counterparts and more attractive due to the new, on-chain-enabled features they champion.</p>
<p>To narrow down what this means, let's consider the rise of DeFi.</p>
<p>Since 2020, the success of protocols like Aave, Uniswap, and Maker has demonstrated, in practice, the power of transacting with minimal fees, globally, and without intermediaries. Truthfully, the term DeFi, stretches far beyond these protocols and their counterparts to all of crypto that deals in financial use cases. Even Bitcoin, for example, may be considered “DeFi,” when it is used to store value, or simply, to do business.</p>
<p>As institutions like Blackrock continue to buy in, that’s only becoming clearer by the day.</p>
<p>While both DeFi and consumer crypto are niches within the same industry, they have considerably different target markets. DeFi aims to provide the future financial system, piece by piece, to institutions, traders, and individuals.</p>
<p>Consumer Crypto is the vision of developing intuitive, sticky, and user-governed applications that leverage blockchain technology to deliver seamless, chain-abstracted experiences. These applications extend beyond financial services, enabling any user to engage with a diverse range of web3 applications for various purposes, fostering widespread adoption, and enhancing everyday digital interactions.</p>
<p>Below, we dig into why that needs to be done, and how we, as builders, can do it.</p>
<h1>Why does consumer crypto matter?</h1>
<p>The top hurdle for web3, as a whole, continues to be how inaccessible it is to the average person. To change that, we need to commit to radically improving how we onboard new users to our apps, how we seek to retain them, and what use cases we’re building for as well as supporting, through grants programs, hackathons, and otherwise.</p>
<p>Once we achieve this, it will become clear why consumer crypto is essential and why it represents the next paradigm shift for all consumer apps.</p>
<p><strong>Seamless Onboarding</strong></p>
<p>From approval signatures to bridging, to holding multiple tokens just for gas fees on different networks, to managing multiple wallets, <a href="https://push.org/blog/the-rise-of-chains-and-fall-of-ux-in-web3-ux/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">and beyond</a>, web3 apps are rife with complexity. Changing the status quo requires unifying the user experience regardless of all these intricacies.</p>
<p>A commitment to learning from web2’s successes and failures is a good start.</p>
<p>Chain abstraction across the board, <a href="https://push.org/blog/the-rise-of-chains-and-fall-of-ux-in-web3-ux/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as we describe in a past post here</a>, takes us further.</p>
<p>Spinning up an account on a web3 app must be as easy if not easier than doing so on something like Facebook.  Simplicity needs to reign across the board in our approach to UX and we need to commit to benchmarking to leading legacy apps that are household names to ensure this happens. Moreover, putting all of the innovations that make this industry great on the back end does not mean hiding them.</p>
<p>Until all of this is achieved, onboarding will continue to be a major barrier to widespread adoption and the advent of an age in which on-chain apps supplant off-chain apps.</p>
<p><strong>Long-Term Retention</strong></p>
<p>Raising retention is a multi-sided problem. To retain users over the long-term, we must ensure better and seamless UX.</p>
<p>With web2’s common approaches to it and the unique features that web3 has in mind, it becomes easier to solve.</p>
<p>Think about the apps you have on your phone. What reminds you to check them? Push notifications. There’s a reason we still need them, even in this space. When done right, they’re one of the most effective methods that apps employ to retain users.</p>
<p>When your phone’s locked and you receive a push notification saying that you got a new message from a friend on an app, you check that app. It’s a reflex, in most cases. The same principle applies to web3. If you’re a trader and you get a push notification in your wallet that says the asset you’re tracking has reached the price you’re looking for, you’ll head to your account and trade that asset. Delegates for a DAO who receive the same sort of notification that a vote has begun will head to Snapshot or wherever that vote is being held to participate. The same goes for fans of a particular NFT artist who receive a ping that a new drop is live or fans of a podcaster who see that a new episode is live.</p>
<p>Push notifications are still key to keeping people engaged, even on-chain.</p>
<p>Beyond push notifications, numerous other methods for enhancing user retention exist, both predating web3 and emerging from it. The initial rise of NFTs has already shown the power of royalties, guaranteed in perpetuity, by smart contracts. Most legacy marketplaces and social media platforms offer only negligible profit-sharing, if any.</p>
<p>It’s the call for change we’ve seen since the earliest days of social media. Give us apps that prioritize the users, including creators, first, above all else.</p>
<p>Add in DAOs as well as the lego-like composability that smart contract-based applications have and you’re starting to get the picture as to how consumer crypto can do that. At present, both creators and general users lack meaningful upside in the apps they use daily. Any significant gains—monetary or otherwise—are subject to the whims of centralized entities.</p>
<p>User-led apps flip the status quo on its head, for the better.</p>
<p>If something isn’t working, it can be changed via a vote. Apps evolve based directly on what their communities want to see and any advertising that is done is opt-in.</p>
<p>Any revenue that’s generated goes both to the app itself, to keep the lights on and keep it scaling, and to its community, with the latter receiving the lion’s share.</p>
<p>Token-based incentives such as higher statuses and higher rewards based on longevity and participation further increase retention even further.</p>
<p><strong>Diversification of Use Cases</strong></p>
<p>However, none of the above matters if we, as an industry, can't demonstrate a stronger commitment to a broader range of use cases for our apps. Currently, the majority of existing web3 apps are DeFi-focused.</p>
<p>Consumer crypto aims to change that by providing intuitive, fun, sticky apps that rival those that are today’s leaders in the social media, gaming, and marketplace niches. Chain abstraction, <a href="https://push.org/blog/cross-chain-requests-pre-pip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cross-chain requests</a>, and <a href="https://push.org/blog/the-rise-of-chains-and-fall-of-ux-in-web3-ux/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">related solutions</a> are making it easier than ever for that to happen.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, through recent hackathons, we’re already able to see consumer apps leading the charge.</p>
<p>Consumer crypto matters because it’s the movement through which web3 expands its boundaries to the next billion users.</p>
<p>It’s the only way that we finally cross the chasm to being the standard-bearers for all online interaction instead of a tech-heavy alternative.</p>
<p>Once everyone in our industry shows commitment to that in practice, consumer crypto will become the dominant driving force for the industry’s move to expand crypto beyond finance and achieve widespread adoption.</p>
<h1>What’s the future of consumer crypto?</h1>
<p>Since Bitcoin's inception, we've advocated for a financial system and a world that levels the playing field more than ever before. Our apps need to strike a balance—easy to use, yet demonstrating these principles in action. We need more engaging, participatory, on-chain economies, of all shapes and sizes, embedded within enjoyable user interfaces.</p>
<p>This doesn’t require reinventing the wheel. Our next break-out moment may come from a team saying, <em>“How can we make a better Instagram with features and functionalities unique to this industry?”</em></p>
<p>That app would likely also be DAOified because you can’t have consumer crypto without governance by the people, for the people. Decentralized Governance, as an overarching model for our future social apps, aligns perfectly with the broader vision of consumer crypto, as it ensures apps evolve in a more participatory fashion than ever before. Web3-app users can have a direct say in how the app they’re using evolves as well as how it approaches key questions like compensation for creators, which is technically not possible in traditional web3 apps, where all control lies in the hands of the few.</p>
<p>Consumer crypto is the next <strong>Schelling</strong> point for our industry.</p>
<p>It's the driving force propelling us toward a future where web3 becomes the standard for all global consumers' online interactions. To travel further down that road, let’s start by building things on-chain that people beyond our sphere, legitimately want to use. Let’s also commit to making crypto easier to use than ever.</p>
<p>With that, we might reach an age in which a web3 app is just an app and a protocol is just a structure behind it.</p>
<p>An age of seamless interaction, on-chain,  where users no longer have to bother about the underlying chain behind their favorite applications.</p>
<p>Here at Push, we’re all aligned and focused on this vision.</p>
<p>If you're building in consumer crypto, then we're here to support you every step of the way. <a href="https://gov.push.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reach out to us</a> and we’ll get you plugged in with our grants program.</p>]]></content>
